lyrics = [intro - Distant Echoes]
oooooo  
sssssshhhh  

[verse 1 - Street Chronicle]
Walking shadows, stories untold  
Echoes in alleys, rhythms unfold  
In the city, where dreams are bought  
Every corner, a secret caught  
zzzzzzzz

[Chorus - Urban Pulse]
oooo  
iiiiii  
Flow through the night, where the heart beats slow  
oooo  
iiiiii  
Feel the pulse, let the rhythm show  

[verse 2 - Lyrical Journey]
Graffiti whispers, on concrete walls  
Voices rise, as the night falls  
In the hustle, where stories blend  
Every word, a means to mend  
ahhhhhh

[Bridge - Neon Dreams]
Neon lights, reflect the past  
In the city, where dreams are cast  
Step by step, through the haze  
Finding truth in urban maze  

[outro - Zephyr Flow]
ssshhhh  
oooooo  
iiiiiiii  
Fade into the night, where stories grow  
oooooo  
iiiiiiii  
In the city's heart, let the rhythm flow
