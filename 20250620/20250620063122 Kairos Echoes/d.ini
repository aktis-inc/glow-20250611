lyrics = [intro]
(soft strumming)  
Time whispers softly, through the cracks  
Gentle echoes, of what once was  
oooooo iiiii

[verse 1 – Twilight Reflections]  
In the fading light, memories dance  
Shadows of yesterday, linger on  
Each breath a story, untold yet near  
Kairos moments, suspended in time  
mmmmmm

[Pre-Chorus – Quiet Moments]  
[soft piano]  
ooooo  
In the pause of life, truths reveal  
Every heartbeat sings, a silent song

[Chorus – Echoes of Now]  
wooooooo  
iiiiii  
In the stillness, we find our way  
Through the echoes, the heart speaks

[Bridge – Time's Embrace]  
We hold the moments, close and dear  
In the silence, they draw near  
ahhhh ooo  
[whispered reflection]

[verse 2 – Gentle Revelations]  
Time doesn't wait, it moves with grace  
We gather pieces, find our place  
Every whisper, carries a name

[outro – Kairos Echoes]
