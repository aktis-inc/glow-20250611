lyrics = [intro – Lantern Glow]
Soft hums, gentle guitar strums
A breeze whispers secrets
oooooo

[verse 1 – Night's Embrace]
In the quiet, stars align
Hearts remember the warmth
Time stands still, serenade

[Chorus – Liora's Call]
woooooo  
Liora sings to the night
Dreams dance in the moonlight

[Bridge – Harmony Flow]
Melody like a river
Flowing through the soul, gentle
ahhhh  
oooooo

[verse 2 – Dusk's Promise]
Lanterns guide the way home
Paths of memory, softly
A song of peace, eternal

[outro – Serenade's End]
Whispered notes fade away
Echoes linger, heart's embrace]
