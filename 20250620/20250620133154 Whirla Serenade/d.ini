[verse 1 – Ocean's Whisper]
Sunset glow, a story untold  
In your eyes, waves unfold  
Hearts in sync, rhythm's call  
Dance the night, hear the soul

[Pre-Chorus – Serenade's Drift]  
oooooo  
wooooooo  
In the light, dreams ignite  
We find our song, take the flight

[Chorus – Whirla's Embrace]  
oooooooo  
iiiiiiii  
Dance with me, feel the beat  
In this serenade, hearts meet

[bridge - Tropical Echo]  
We move, we sway, in tune  
Underneath the silver moon  
Ahhhhhh  
shhhhhhhh

[verse 2 – Ember's Glow]
Through the night, whispers flow  
With every step, love will grow  
In the moment, time will slow  
Together, forever, we follow

[glitch build-up]  
oooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiii

[outro - Fade to Glow]
Feel the night, let it go  
In Whirla's arms, we glow
