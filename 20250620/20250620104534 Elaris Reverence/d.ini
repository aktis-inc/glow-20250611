lyrics = [intro - Awakening]
(soft instrumental)  
Elaris' morning light breaks  
oooooo iiiii  

[verse 1 – Earth Pulse]  
Rhythms call from ancient sands  
Spirits dance in every strand  
Life's a song, we sing as one  
Elaris' journey has begun  

[Pre-Chorus – Echoing Call]  
ooooo  
Harmony in every heart  
Unity will never part  

[Chorus – Reverence]  
ooooo  
iiiiii  
Elaris guides us through the sound  
Every step a sacred ground  

[Bridge - Spirit Dance]  
Winds whisper tales of old  
Stories in the skies unfold  
ahhhhhh  
ooooooo  

[outro - Elaris Reverence]  
[guitar strum and fade]  
Harmony in life's embrace  
Elaris leads with gentle grace
