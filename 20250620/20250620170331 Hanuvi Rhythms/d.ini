lyrics = [intro - serene chimes]

ooooo  
oooooooooooo  

[verse 1 - Sacred Flow]  
Beneath the banyan, whispers rise  
Tabla beats, like heart's own ties  
Harmony in each breath, we find  
In chants of old, peace of mind  
aaaaaaaaa  

[chorus - Divine Echo]  
ooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiii  
Together we call, in sacred streams  
Harmony flows, in divine dreams  

[bridge - Spiritual Ascent]  
Lotus blooms, in the soul's embrace  
Chanting echoes, in sacred space  
ahhhhhhhhhh  
wooooooo  

[verse 2]  
Gentle flute, in tranquil air  
Melodies weave, in prayer's care  
Nature's voice, in harmony  
In every note, divinity  

[outro - Hanuvi Rhythms]  
iiiiiiiiii  
oooooo  
[soft chimes fade]
