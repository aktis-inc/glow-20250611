lyrics = [intro - Awakening]

[chant]
iiiii oooooo aaaa

[verse - Energy Flow]
Waves of sound, like rivers
Flow through the cosmic space
Spirit rise, in the beat
Dance with the unseen grace

[chant]
wooooooo iiiiiiii

[build-up - Ascension]
Echos whisper, in the night
Light transcends the earthly bind
Pulsing heart, of the trance
Guides the journey, undefined

[chorus - Celestial Dance]
oooooh aaaahh
iiiiiiiiii
Hearts unite, in the sound
Boundless realm, we have found

[bridge - Ethereal Echo]
Chants of power, fill the air
Mystic journey, unaware
Guided by the rhythm's call
We rise, we never fall

[chant]
oooooo iiiii

[outro - Wynra's Trance]
Echoing whispers fade
Into the night, we drift away
Wynra's trance, the timeless path
In the sound, we forever stay
