lyrics = [intro - Dawn's Whisper]
oooooo

[verse 1 - Heart's Call]
Gentle winds carry the song  
Of dreams that awaken with the light  
In the quiet dawn, whispers rise  
A tale of love, beyond the sky  

oooooo

[Chorus - Soul's Embrace]  
In the heart's echo, we find  
The melody of time and grace  
Through every tear, every smile  
Our souls dance in eternal embrace  

[Bridge - Celestial Dance]  
ooooo aaaaa  
iiiiii  
The stars align, guiding our way  
In this symphony, we sway  

[outro - Echo's Fade]  
As the sun rises, the echoes remain  
In the silence, love's refrain  
oooooo
