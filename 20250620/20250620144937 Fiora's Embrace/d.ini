lyrics = [intro]
oooooo iiiiiii  

[verse 1]  
Soft whispers of the past  
In melodies that last  
Through time and space they glide  
Fiora's gentle tide  

[bridge - Harmonic Drift]  
ssshhhh  
oooooo  

[chorus]  
Together we sing  
In harmony we bring  
A world of colors bright  
In Fiora's light  

[instrumental - Strings & Sitar]  
ziiiiiii zaaaaaa  

[verse 2]  
Echoes of ancient lore  
Blend with the new, explore  
In waves of sound, we find  
Fiora's embrace, entwined  

[outro]  
oooooo iiiiii  
Fiora, ever kind
