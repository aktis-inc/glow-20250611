lyrics = [intro - gentle strum]

[verse 1 – Whispers of Time]
Soft light, morning haze  
Dreams unfold in vivid ways  
ooooo iiiii

[Pre-Chorus – Echoed Steps]  
Heart beats, sync with the sea  
Every note, a memory

[Chorus – Soul's Embrace]  
wooooooo  
iiiiii  
Feel the rhythm, let it flow  
In the silence, love will grow

[Bridge - Starlit Path]  
We walk the line, beneath the stars  
Every moment, never far  
ahhhhhh oooooo

[verse 2]
Whispered secrets, gentle breeze  
Life's a dance, set to please  
zzzzzzhhhhhh  

[outro - Fade to Harmony]
Soft echoes, fading light  
In Rylas, all is right
