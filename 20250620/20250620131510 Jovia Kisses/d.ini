[soft verse]
mmmmmm 
oooooo

[verse - City Light]
Gentle rain, on city skin
Whispers blend, with the wind
Floating dreams, in this space
Hearts align, in a gentle chase
oooo aaaaa

[chorus - Jovia Embrace]
Soft kisses beneath neon skies
Cocoa warmth in our sighs
mmmmmm

[bridge - Dream Flow]
In the glow, time slows
We dance, where love grows
oooooooo

[outro - Fade]
City hum, fades away
Jovia, in the night we sway
ooooo iiiiii]
