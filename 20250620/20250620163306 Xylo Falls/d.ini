lyrics = [intro ripple]

[verse 1]

Trace the water's edge, soft whispers glide  
Gone are the shadows, in currents abide  
oooooo

[chorus – Liquid Dream]

Flow with the earth, gentle embrace  
In silence, echoes find their place  
iiiiiiii

[bridge – Reflection]

Mirrors of time, cascading ways  
Glimmer of hope in endless lays  
shhhhhh

[outro – Xylo Falls]
