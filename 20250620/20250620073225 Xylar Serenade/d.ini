lyrics = [intro - gentle river flow]

[verse - evening whispers]
The sun dips low, casting golden hues  
In the embrace of time, moments gently fuse  
ooooo  
iiiiiiii

[chorus - serene call]  
Whispers of past and future intertwine  
Melodies of heart, timeless as the divine  
ahhhhh  
eeeeee  

[bridge - celestial dance]  
Stars emerge in the twilight's gentle glow  
Echoes of dreams, in the night they softly flow  
zzzzzzzz  
mmmmmm

[verse - reflections]  
Beneath the temple's ancient shade  
Harmony unspoken, serenades are made  
ooooo  
iiiiiii

[outro - fading light]  
As the night cradles the earth in its gentle embrace  
The serenade lingers, a tender, timeless space  
sshhhhhh  
ooooo]
