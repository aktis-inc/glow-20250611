oooo ooooo iiiiii
Stones whisper tales untold
Pathways carved in myths of old

[chorus - Rise of the Glint]
ahhhhhhhh
In the light, shadows play
Guiding us through the fray

zzzzzzzz oooooo
Voices rise, in harmony
Echoes of eternity

[outro - Fading Glimmer]
shhhh
As the light begins to fade
In silence, history is made
