lyrics = [intro - Festive Start]
ahhhh iiiiii  
Cheers echo through the night

[verse 1 – Bright Gather]  
Clink of glasses, stories told  
Laughter dances in the air  
Every face a radiant glow  
Life's a feast, beyond compare  
oooooo

[Chorus – Joyful Toast]  
Raise your glass to the sky  
oooooooooooooo  
Celebrate with open hearts

[bridge - Rhythmic Pulse]  
Dance in circles, spin around  
Feel the music, lose the ground  
[echoed cheer]

[verse 2]  
Voices blend in harmony  
Underneath the starry sky  
Moments shared, forever free

[outro - Celebration Fade]  
woooooo iiiiiii  
Joyful echoes, lingering high
