[verse]

Jorai brings the beat alive
In the heart of the city lights

[dance break]

Feel the pulse, feel the drive
Tradition whispers in the night

[chorus]

ooooooo aaaaa

[bridge]

Rhythms of old, stories untold
Dance with the wind, let it unfold

[verse]

Jorai's song, a joyful ride
In every step, in every stride

[outro fade]
