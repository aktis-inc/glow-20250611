lyrics = [intro - City Pulse]
(Beat starts)  
yo yo yo ooooooo  
[verse 1 - Urban Groove]  
In the city, where the lights shine bright  
Steppin' to the rhythm in the neon night  
Brevio's the name, bringin' heat to the scene  
Flow so clean, with a lyrical machine  
ooooo iiiii

[Pre-Chorus - Street Symphony]  
Clap your hands, feel the bassline drop  
Move your feet, let the rhythm pop  
wooooo  
[Chorus - Brevio Beat]  
B to the R, E-V-I-O  
Rockin' the block, makin' the city glow  
aaaaa

[Bridge - Vibrant Flow]  
Graffiti dreams on the walls we climb  
In this urban jungle, we find our rhyme  
shhhhhh  
[verse 2 - Dynamic Verse]  
Catch the vibe, as we ride the sound  
In the heart of the city, where the beats are found  
oooooo

[outro - Night Echo]  
(Beat fades)  
City whispers, as we drift away  
Brevio Beat, in the night we sway
