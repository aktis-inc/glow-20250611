(Soft echo)
oooooo
iiiiii  
[verse 1 - Daybreak Whispers]
In the sky, dreams unfold,  
Sunrise paints stories untold,
Beneath the banyan, tales of old  
sssshhhhhh

[chorus - Lumina Embrace]  
ooooooo  
iiiiii  
Warmth in heart, like a glowing flame,
Harmony sings, calling your name  
[soft flute interlude]

[bridge - Celestial Dance]  
In the night, stars align,
Guiding paths, intertwine  
oooooo  
[soft tabla rhythm]

[verse 2 - Twilight Echoes]
Moon’s glow, a lullaby’s touch,
In its light, we find so much  
zzzzzhh  
oooooo 

[outro - Serenade's End]
Harmonies fade into night’s embrace,  
In dreams, we float, a gentle chase  
oooooo iiiiiiii
