lyrics = [intro]

[gentle rise]
ooooo

[verse 1 – Awakening]
In the city of dreams, whispers of tales
Colors unfurl, in the morning sails
oooooo
iiiiiii

[Pre-Chorus – Harmony Awaits]
Beneath the sky, the rhythm flows
Every step, a story grows

[Chorus – Jovial Dance]
oooooo  
iiiiiiiiii

[Bridge - Embrace]
Together we weave, the threads of time
Every heartbeat, a gentle rhyme
ahhhhhh hhhhhh

[outro - Journey's End]
iiii oooo
Echoes of laughter, fading light
In this journey, day turns to night
