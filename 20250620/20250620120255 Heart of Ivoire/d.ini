lyrics = [intro – Neon Glimmer]

[verse 1 – Pulse of the City]
In shadows of glass towers  
Heartbeats echo through rain  
Light bends around corners  
ooooo aaaa

[Pre-Chorus – Electric Whisper]
City's sighs, whispers in the dark  
Emotions like tides, pulling apart  
iiiiiiii

[Chorus – Heart of Ivoire]
Feel the rhythm, feel the night  
In the glow, we take flight  
wooooo  
oooooo

[Bridge – Reflective Streets]
Neon dreams and endless roads  
A journey where the heart unfolds  
shhhhhhh

[verse 2 – Luminous Echoes]
Under stars, the city breathes  
Every note a memory we weave  
ttttttt

[outro – Fading Lights]
ooooo iiiiii  
Echoes linger, night takes flight  
Heart of Ivoire, glowing bright
