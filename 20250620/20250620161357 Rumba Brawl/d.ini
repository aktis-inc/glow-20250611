[verse 1]
In the streets where stars collide
Rhumba moves, can't hide
oooo ooooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

[Chorus – Battle Dance]
Feel the beat, the clash of night
Every move, a spark of light

[Bridge - Starry Showdown]
Dancing through the neon glow
In this game, we lose or grow
Ahhh ooooo

[verse 2]
Tropical winds, they guide our fight
In every step, we find our might

[Chorus – Battle Dance]
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[outro - Rumba Brawl]
The rhythm's pulse, a call to all
In the dance, we stand or fall  
oooo oooooo
