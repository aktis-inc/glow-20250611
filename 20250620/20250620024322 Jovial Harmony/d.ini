[verse 1 - Village Tales]
In the village, stories old  
Echo through the fields of gold  
Every whisper, every song  
Keeps the heart so warm and strong  
oooo iiiii

[Chorus - Harmonious Life]  
woooooo  
In the heart, where roots belong  
Jovial dance to nature's song  
aaaaaaa

[Bridge - Sunset Glow]  
Colors blend, in twilight's glow  
Life's a river, let it flow  
ahhhhhhhhh  
[echoing laughter]

[verse 2 - Sweet Reunion]
Gathered here, hand in hand  
Love and laughter, understand  
In the silence, hear the call  
Of the earth, embracing all

[outro - Golden Horizon]  
[soft flute fade]  
ooooooo iiiiiii
