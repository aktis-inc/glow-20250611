lyrics = [intro - Dawn Symphony]
The city breathes, light ascends  
oooooooooo iiiiiiiiii

[verse 1 – Urban Pulse]  
Among the towers, dreams ignite  
(whispers of hope echo wide)  
The rhythm of life, a vibrant tide

[Pre-Chorus – Rise and Shine]  
ooooo  
awakened soul, melody flies  
In every heart, a spark ignites

[Chorus – Elaris Awakening]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii  
Embrace the light, the day is new  
The world awaits, alive and true

[Bridge - Skyline Harmony]  
In the glow, we find our way  
Through the dawn, we rise and sway  
ahhhhhhhhhh  
[echoed whispers]

[verse 2]  
City lights dance, a radiant show  
(Every step, a chance to grow)  
In the heart, the music flows

[outro - Dawn Symphony Reprise]  
shiiiiiii  
The city breathes, light ascends  
ooooo
