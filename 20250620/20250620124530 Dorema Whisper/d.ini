lyrics = [intro]
ooooo iiiii

[verse 1 - Gentle Echo]
Whispers in the breeze carry tales
Of distant lands and silent dreams
tttttaaaa
Softly woven heartbeats

[Pre-Chorus - Tranquil Harmony]
Flow like river streams, unseen
In the quiet of the dawn
oooooo

[Chorus - Soulful Dance]
Melodies sway, with the sun
Rising gently, whispers hum
iiiii eeeee

[Bridge - Mystical Lull]
In the lotus garden, secrets sing
Veil of mist, in harmony
aaaaahhhh

[verse 2]
Golden light through leaves, serene
Echoes dance on water's skin
nnnnnnnn

[outro - Dorema Whisper]
Dreams dissolve in morning light
Carried softly, on the breeze]
