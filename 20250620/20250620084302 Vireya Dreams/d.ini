lyrics = [intro - Neon Awakening]
shhhhhh  
ooooo

[verse 1 - Vireya's Call]  
In the glow of twilight's embrace  
Silent whispers trace the sky  
iiiiiiii ooooo  

[Pre-Chorus - Horizon Pulse]  
Vibrant echoes rise and fall  
Every note a step to fly

[Chorus - Dream Dance]  
oooooo   
iiiiiiii ahhhh  
Dreams alight, in shades of flight

[Bridge - Ethereal Flow]  
Rivers of light, weaving tales  
Through the night, we sail  
ahhhhhh shhhhhh

[verse 2]  
Colors merge in a cosmic weave  
Melodies dance, hearts believe

[outro - Vireya's Fade]  
ooooo  
shhhhh  
Bloom in the silence of the night
