(soft echoes) iiiii oooooo

[verse 1 - Blossoming Hope]  
In the silence, whispers grow  
Fleuri's light begins to show  
ooooo aaaaa

[Pre-Chorus - Gentle Rise]  
(soft harmonies)  
Breathe in the quiet glow  
Every prayer, a silent vow  

[Chorus - Serene Echoes]  
wooooo  
Silent prayers, gentle flow  
iiiiiii ooooo

[Bridge - Celestial Light]  
Light beams dance across the sky  
In the calm, our spirits fly  
shhhhhhh

[outro - Fleuri's Prayer]  
(soft winds)  
oooooo  
iiiii  
[fade into serenity]
