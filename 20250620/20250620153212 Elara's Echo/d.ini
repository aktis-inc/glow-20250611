lyrics = [intro - gentle breeze]

[verse - Whispering Leaves]
In the shadows of the hills, echoes of time
Weaving stories with the wind, in a melodic rhyme
aaaa eeee oooo

[chorus - Elara's Call]
Elara, your song traverses the night
Guiding spirits with a gentle light

[bridge - River's Flow]
Flow with the river, where dreams unite
In the embrace of the moon, the past ignites

[outro - Echo's Return]
Elara's echo, a timeless flight
In the heart of night, a song takes flight
oooo eee iiiii
