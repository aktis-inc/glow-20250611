iiiiii

[verse – Celestial Path]  
Whispers of ancient tales,  
Stars align in sacred dance,  
Sitar sings, tabla speaks,  
Harmony in cosmic trance  
ooooo

[chorus – Nirva's Embrace]  
mmmmmmm  
Ethereal light guides the way,  
In the silence, peace will stay  
oooooo

[bridge – Temporal Flow]  
Time dissolves in cosmic streams,  
Ancient rhythms, modern dreams  
iiiiiii

[outro – Harmony's Echo]  
Softly, gently, whispers fade  
Nirva's light will never wane  
ooooooo
