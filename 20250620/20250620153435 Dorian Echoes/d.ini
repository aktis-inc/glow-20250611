lyrics = [intro]
Soft strums, heart's whisper

[verse]
In the quiet of the night, thoughts drift
Shadows dance with the moon's soft glow
oooooo

[chorus]
Why do hearts change? Soft echoes call
Our dreams, like leaves, fall and turn
iiiiiiiiiii

[bridge]
Beneath the stars, questions linger
In the silence, truth awakens

[outro]
Dorian echoes fade, gentle sighs
