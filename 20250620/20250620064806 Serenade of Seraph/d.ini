lyrics = [intro - Serene Prelude]
(Whispered) ooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiii

[verse 1 – Echoes of Love]  
In the moon's gentle embrace, shadows dance  
Your voice, a melody, across the night's expanse  
Ssshhhhh aaaaahhhh

[Chorus – Heart's Serenade]  
ooooooo  
In the silence, your essence sings  
I find my soul in your gentle strings  
iiiiiiiiii

[Bridge – Celestial Interlude]  
A moment suspended in time’s tender gaze  
Stars align in this love's eternal maze  
oooo aaaa

[verse 2 – Whispered Dreams]  
Underneath the starlit sky, dreams unfold  
In your eyes, stories untold  
Hhhhhaaaaaa

[Outro – Fading Echo]  
(Softly) ooooooooo  
iiiiiiiii  
Love’s fragrance lingers, forever bold
