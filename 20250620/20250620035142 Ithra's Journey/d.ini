lyrics = [intro beat]
[smooth synth]  
[verse 1 – City Awakening]  
The skyline whispers dreams untold  
Through the night, bold stories unfold  
oooooo iiiiii

[Pre-Chorus – Neon Pulse]  
Shadows dance in rhythm's embrace  
A journey begins, finding my place  
wooooooo

[Chorus – Ithra's Echo]  
I'm the pulse of the city lights  
Guided by the stars so bright  
Feel the beat, lose the fight  
aaaaaa oooohhh

[Bridge – Pathway Glimmer]  
Footsteps echo on the streets  
With every turn, destiny greets  
Ahhh iiiii

[verse 2 – Horizon Bound]  
Boundless skies, no limits found  
In this journey, I am crowned  
zzzzz ooooo

[outro fade]  
In the city's heart, dreams ignite  
My Ithra journey, taking flight  
shhhhhh]
