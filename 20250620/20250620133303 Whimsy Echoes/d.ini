lyrics = [intro]

[verse 1 – Whirling Colors]
Dance in vibrant shadows  
Echoes of forgotten lands   
Swirling in the cosmic flow  
Illusions in hand  

[chorus – Harmonious Fusion]  
wooooo  
iiiiiiiii  
Together we spark, in the night  

[bridge – Rhythmic Pulse]  
Heartbeat sync, worlds collide  
Ancient whispers, modern tide  
oooo ahhhh  

[verse 2 – Melodic Journey]
Across starry tales we roam  
Bound by threads unseen  
Each note a journey home  
A melody serene  

[chorus – Harmonious Fusion]  
wooooo  
iiiiiiiii  
Together we spark, in the night  

[outro – Whimsy Echoes]  
Fade into the horizon's glow  
A dream's soft embrace  
iiiii ooooo
