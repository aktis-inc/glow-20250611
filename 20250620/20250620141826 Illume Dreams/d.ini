[verse 1 â€“ Dreamscape]
In the whisper of leaves
Ancient tales unfold
Rhythms of the past
Harmonize with the now
aaaaaaaa

[Pre-Chorus â€“ Illume Light]
Shadows play, light reveals
Dancing through the veils
iiiiii oooooo

[Chorus â€“ Ethereal Rise]
Rise with the dawn
Dreams take flight
In the heart of sound
wooooooo iiiii

[Bridge - Fusion Flow] 
Tradition and future
Hand in hand, they move
A dance of time
ahhhhhh

oooooo
fading into light
iiiiii
dreams linger on
