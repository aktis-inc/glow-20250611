[gentle verse]
ooooommmmm
River whispers, lotus blooms
In the light, echoes of dawn
Gavril hums in harmony

iiiiii
Temple bells call softly
Spirit dances with the breeze

[chorus - spiritual embrace]
oooo
In the quiet, find the path
Through the heart, peace will guide

[outro - tranquil fade]
mmmmmm
Lotus dreams and river sighs
Gavril's echo, gentle and wide
