lyrics = [intro - gentle strum]

[verse 1 – City Lights]  
In the night's embrace, we find our pace  
Neon glows, and the rhythm flows  
oooooo iiiiii

[Pre-Chorus – Electric Pulse]  
Feel the beat beneath our feet  
Every step a story, every glance a dance  

[Chorus – Glimmer Groove]  
wooooooo  
Shimmer, glimmer, in the city's heart  
Together we ignite, never apart  
aaaaa

[Bridge - Midnight Echo]  
In shadows, whispers of dreams  
Echoes of laughter, like flowing streams  
oooo eeeeee

[verse 2]  
Underneath the glowing signs  
Our paths align, like stars that shine  

[outro - Fade into Dawn]  
As night fades, we greet the dawn  
With every beat, a new day's song]
