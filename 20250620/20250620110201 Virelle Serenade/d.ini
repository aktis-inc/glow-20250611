lyrics = [intro – Whispering Leaves]
(Soft hum) iiiiii  
(Soft hum) ooooo  

[verse 1 – Forest Echoes]
In the quiet of the trees  
Where the shadows meet the light  
Every whisper tells a story  
Every leaf a silent sigh  
zzzzzz  

[chorus – Heart's Serenade]  
oooooo  
Virelle in my dreams, I see you there  
In the melody of the air  

[bridge – Ethereal Dance] 
Among the branches, shadows play  
A dance of light, a serenade  
ahhhhhh  

[verse 2 – Sunlit Paths]  
Through the mist, the sun breaks through  
Guiding paths we never knew  
In the silence, hearts align  

[outro – Fading Light]  
shhhhhh  
Virelle's song, a gentle flight  
ooooooo]
