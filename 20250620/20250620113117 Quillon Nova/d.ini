wooooo
iiiiii

[verse 1 – Neon Rise]
City lights ignite the night
Every pulse a vivid flight
Echoes chase the dreams we find
Quillon guides the way we ride
ooooooo

[Chorus – Nova Pulse]
Shimmering across the sky
Feel the rhythm, let it fly
Voices blend in harmony
Together, we set free
woooooooo

[Bridge - Electric Flow]
Through the beats and glowing streets
We find the pulse that never sleeps
A journey bold, a story told
In Quillon's light, we unfold
oooo iiiiiiiii

[outro - Fade to Neon]
City whispers, echoes call
In this night, we stand tall
In the glow of Quillon's sign
Eternal rhythm, intertwined
wooooo aaaaaa
