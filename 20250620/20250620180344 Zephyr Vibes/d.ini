[verse 1]
Whispers in the air, cities never sleep  
Colors blend in light, stories that we keep  
oooooo
   
[chorus - Zephyr Flow]  
Dance in the breeze, ancient and new  
oooooo aaaaa  
Feel the zephyr, guiding you through  

[bridge - Cultural Echo]  
Traditions whisper, echoes of the past  
In the neon glow, futures are cast  
ssshhhhhhhhhh  

[verse 2]
Rhythms of the heart, beating in sync  
Worlds collide, as eyes blink  
iiiiii ooooo aaaaa  

[outro - Fade to Horizon]
