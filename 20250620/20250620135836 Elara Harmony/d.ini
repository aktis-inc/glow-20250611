lyrics = [intro - Ethereal Echo]

[verse 1 – Mountain Murmurs]
In the mist, the tales unfold
Echoes of the old, in rhythms bold
oooo aaaa

[chorus – Harmony Rise]
Elara, sing the dawn
Where past and future align
oooooo iiiiii

[bridge – Tradition's Embrace]
Whispering winds, guiding home
Through time and dreams we roam
ahhhh ooooo

[verse 2 – Future's Dance]
Steps in sync with ancient song
New horizons, where we belong
oooo iiiii

[outro - Fade to Horizon]
In the light, we find our way
Elara's call, a new day
