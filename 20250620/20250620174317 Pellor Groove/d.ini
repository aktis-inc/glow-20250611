lyrics = [intro - cityscape echoes]

[verse 1 – Night Walk]
Neon dreams in the city's heart  
Pellor takes the rhythm's part  
oooo aaahhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Skyline Pulse]  
Lights and beats intertwine  
Groove on the skyline  
oooooo

[Chorus – Urban Flow]  
iiiii aaaa  
Feel the pulse, feel the flow  
Riding high, down below

[Bridge – Echoes in Motion]  
Skyscrapers hum the city tune  
Pellor's beat under the moon  
shhhhhh oooo

[verse 2]
Streetlights paint the path ahead  
In this groove, the night is fed  
aaaa iiiii

[outro - Rhythm Fade]  
Pellor's groove, a fading light  
In the city, out of sight  
oooooo]
