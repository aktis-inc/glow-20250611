[ambient whispers]  
ooooo

[verse]  
In the night, echoes of a forgotten tale  
Gulaberi blooms, under the stars, pale  
iiiiii

[chorus]  
Fiora sings, in the shadow's light  
Banjara dreams, taking flight  
oooooo

[bridge]  
Through the sands, memories flow  
Kalo koni kata, where the heart goes  
oooo aaaa

[outro]  
[soft hum]  
Fiora's echo fades into the night
