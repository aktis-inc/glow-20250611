[verse 1 – Neon Streets]
Colors swirl in the night
Rhythms pulse, hearts ignite
oooo ahhhh aaaaa

[Chorus – Currant Groove]
Dance and sway, feel the beat
Energy flows through the street
iiiiii oooooo

[Bridge – Market Glow]
Voices rise, laughter echoes
Underneath the vibrant shadows
shhhh ooooo

[verse 2]
Joyful steps, paths entwine
A celebration of life in time
zzzzz iiiii
