lyrics = [intro - City Awakens]

[verse - Rhythmic Pulse]  
In echoes of the past, the city breathes  
A dance of shadows, where dreams weave

[pre-chorus - Rising Tide]  
oooo  
Through ancient streets, life flows  
A melody that never slows

[chorus - Dulcet Echoes]  
wooooo  
A harmony of worlds collide  
In rhythm, our hearts abide

[bridge - Urban Fusion]  
Tradition whispers in the night  
Future glimmers, a guiding light  
ahhhh ahhhh

[verse 2 - Echoes Resound]  
From alleyways to neon skies  
A song of life, never dies

[outro - Fade to Harmony]  
iiiiii ooooooo  
City hums, a lullaby  
In Dulcet Echoes, we fly
