[verse 1]
In the stillness of twilight's glow  
Rivai calls with whispers low  
ooooo  
iiiiii

[chorus - Heart's Echo]
Under the sky's warm embrace  
Memories dance in gentle pace  
woooooo  
ahhhhhh

[bridge - Reflective Pause]
Softly the river flows on  
Carrying echoes till dawn  
ooooo  
shhhh

[outro - Sunset Reprise]
Rivai's song fades with the light  
Dreams take flight into the night  
iiiiii  
oooooo
