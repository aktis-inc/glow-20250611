[verse 1 – Cultural Roots]
Voices rise like morning sun
In the heart of the land, we gather
Drums echo stories untold
Unity in every note

[Chorus – Harmonious Journey]
iiii ooooo iiiii
Hands in rhythm, hearts align
In the dance of life, we find

[verse 2 – Rhythmic Pulse]
Traditions weave through time
Colors of sound, vibrant and bright
Steps that mark our legacy
Together, we move, we sing

[Bridge - Ancestral Call]
oooooo iiiiiii
From the past, the future's born
In every beat, our spirits soar

[outro – Dara's Journey]
iiii ooooo iiiii
Harmony guides, light within
Across horizons, we transcend
