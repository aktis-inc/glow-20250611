lyrics = [intro]
whispering trees
gentle waves, soft light

[verse]
sajaya, the wind's gentle call
melodies woven through the air
dreams drift on the river's edge
oooooo aaaaah 

[chorus]
floating, timeless
echoes in the heart
soul's quiet dance

[bridge]
stars twinkle in whispered notes
every chord a gentle sigh
beneath the moon's soft glow

[outro]
serenade of night
sajaya's gentle embrace
iiii ooo ahhhh]
