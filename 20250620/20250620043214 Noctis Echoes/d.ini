lyrics = [intro - Whispered Dawn]

[verse 1]
Beneath the fading light  
Dreams gently sway  
In silent echoes' flight  
Words drift away  

[Pre-Chorus - Heartbeats Align]  
ooooooo  
Silent melodies, tender embrace  
In the stillness, we find our place  

[Chorus - Twilight Refrain]  
woooooo  
Through the night, we softly glide  
In Noctis echoes, our hearts confide  

[Bridge - Echoing Whispers]  
In shadows deep, we softly tread  
Whispered words remain unsaid  
iiiii aaaaa

[outro - Fading Embrace]
