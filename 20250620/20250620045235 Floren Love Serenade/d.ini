lyrics = [Intro - Whispering Stars]
Ahhhhhh ooooooo  
[soft tabla beat]

[Verse 1]
Under the moon's embrace, we sway  
Time whispers gently, love's ballet  
Floren blooms, a serenade's light  
In dreams we dance, hearts take flight  
oooooo

[Chorus ‚Äì Eternal Dance]
Love's melody, a timeless trance  
In your arms, the world in glance  
Floren sings, the night unfolds  
Feelings untold, whispers bold  
ahhhhhh

[Bridge - Heart's Echo]
Strings of fate, woven in time  
Flute's sweet call, your hand in mine  
Floren's tune, a gentle rhyme  
Together, forever, love's prime  
iiiiii

[Verse 2]
Stars align, our hearts align  
In this moment, love's design  
A serenade, of dreams divine  
With Floren, our souls entwine  
oooooo

[Outro - Serenade's End]
Softly fades, the night's embrace  
Love's sweet song, time can't erase  
Floren's serenade, eternal grace  
Ahhhh aaaaah ooooooo  
[soft flute fade]
