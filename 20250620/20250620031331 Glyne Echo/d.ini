[verse]

Whispers in the neon glow  
Silent echoes, softly flow  
iiiiiiii

[ambient chorus]
Glyne echoes, in the night  
Stars align, guiding light  
oooo aaaaa

[bridge - Celestial Drift]
Through the void, we softly tread  
Dreams align, where angels led  
zzzzzz

[outro - Echo Fade]
Glyne, in the silence we find  
A thousand petals of the mind  
oooo iiiii
