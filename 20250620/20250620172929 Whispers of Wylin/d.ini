lyrics = [intro - gentle mist]

[verse]

[soft acoustic strum]  

[verse - Whispers]

Solitude in the breeze
Echoes of a distant dream
Gentle notes weave the past
Silent heartbeats, stories untold

[Pre-Chorus - Harmonium's Embrace]  
[soft tabla rhythm]
oooooo
Tales of yesteryear unfold
In the whispers of the night

[Chorus - Soul's Reflection]  
wooo  
iiiiiiiii

[Bridge - Ethereal Sunset] 
Dancing shadows, fading light
Melody drifts, soft and bright
Ahhhh shhhhhhhh  
[echoed sigh]

[verse - Final Reverie]
Past and present intertwine
Silent whispers, gentle lines
Life's tapestry, woven with care

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[distorted whisper] memories... linger... softly... (oo-yeah!)

[outro - Whispers of Wylin]
