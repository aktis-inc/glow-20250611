lyrics = [intro - gentle breeze]

[verse]
In the silence of the night  
Echoes of dreams take flight  
A melody woven in light  

[soft chorus]
ooooo  
iiiiiiiii  

[verse 2]
Whispers of time, softly speak  
In this dream, we find what we seek  
Hearts entwined in gentle peace  

[Pre-Chorus – Echo of Dreams]  
oooooooooo  
In the stillness, we breathe  
In the dream, we believe  

[Chorus – Eternal Flow]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Dreamscape] 
Floating on clouds of grace  
In this place, we find our space  
Ahhhh shhhhhh  

[outro - Elandra Dream]
