lyrics = [intro - Desert Whispers]
whirrrr ooooo  

[verse 1 – Neon Dunes]  
Across the sands, where the sun glows  
Camels stride in electric rows  
Tradition hums in modern flows  
ooooo iiiiii  

[chorus – Whimsy Ride]  
Ride the neon wave  
Feel the rhythm's brave  
Desert's secret rave  
oooo ooo  

[bridge - Echoes of Time]  
Time bends, tales blend, in the breeze  
With every step, the old meets the new  
ahhhhhh shhhhh  

[outro - Fade to Horizon]  
Desert whispers, journey's end  
In the glow, horizons bend  
oooo iiiii
