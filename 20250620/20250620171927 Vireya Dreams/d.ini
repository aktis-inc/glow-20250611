lyrics = [intro - ethereal whispers]

[verse - Gentle Winds]
Floating on dreams, where the sky meets the sea  
Whispering tales, carried by the breeze  
ooooo iiiii  

[Pre-Chorus - Rising Light]  
Softly we glide, on wings of time  
Every note, a guiding rhyme

[Chorus - Vireya Dreams]  
wooooo  
In the realm of endless dreams  
Where the heart's echo redeems

[Bridge - Celestial Dance]  
A dance of stars, in silent grace  
Embrace the light, in this sacred space  
ahhhhh  

[verse - Serenity's Call]
Through veils of night, we find our song  
Harmonies weave, where we belong

[outro - Fade to Dawn]  
iiiiii aaaah  
Dreams unfold, as night gives way to dawn  
The melody lingers, forever drawn
