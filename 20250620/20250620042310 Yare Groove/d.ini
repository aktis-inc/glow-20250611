ooooo  
[verse 1 – Vibe Set]  
Rhythm in the air, we move  
Colors of the night, alive  
Echoes of the past, we groove  
iiiiii  

[Chorus – Yare Call]  
Yare, Yare, feel the beat  
In the streets, in our feet  
ooooo  

[Bridge – Horns Rise]  
Sound of the city, rise and flow  
Feel the horns, let them grow  
ahhhh

Steps we take, hearts align  
In the moment, we shine  
ooooo

Yare, Yare, in the sound  
Feel the groove, all around  
ooooo]
