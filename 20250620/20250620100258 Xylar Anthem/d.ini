[verse]

Dhol beats echo through the night  
Power in every rhythm, every light  
Soniye, the world spins in our name  
Unstoppable, we play the game  
aaaaaaahhhhhhhh

[chorus - Anthem Rise]  
oooooo  
Commanding voices raise the sky  
With every beat, we fly so high

[bridge - Dynamic Flow]  
Energy like waves, we ride  
Through the sound, our spirits glide  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

[verse 2]

In the beat, our legacy stands  
Strength and unity in our hands  
Soniye, the vibe is ours to claim  
Together we rise, in the name of fame  
zzzzzzhhhhh

[outro - Xylar Echo]  
ooooo  
iiiiii  
Through the sound, we ascend  
Xylar Anthem without end
