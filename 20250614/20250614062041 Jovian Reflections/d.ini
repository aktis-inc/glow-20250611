lyrics = [intro echo]
City lights flicker, dreams unfold  
(Emotional rap) Thoughts linger, unspoken truths  
ooooo iiiiii  

[verse 1 - Neon Glow]  
Walking through shadows, heart on my sleeve  
Past memories, they never leave  
Life's a canvas, painted with tears  
Yet I rise, facing my fears  
zzzzzzhhhhhh  

[Pre-Chorus - Urban Pulse]  
Beat of the city, echoes of time  
Every step forward, crossing the line  
wooooooo  

[Chorus - Reflections]  
In the night, I find my way  
Jovian dreams, guiding my stay  
ooooo iiiiii  

[Bridge - Distant Lights]  
Neon whispers, calling my name  
In this journey, nothing's the same  
Ahhhhhh shhhhh  

[verse 2 - Heartbeat]  
Stars above, silent and bright  
Guiding me through the endless night  
In my soul, a fire burns  
Every lesson, a page I turn  

[outro - Jovian Reflections]  
Silent rain, washing away  
Echoes of my last day  
ooooo iiiiii  
[fade]
