ooooo

[verse 1]
Whispered tales in twilight glow
Dreams afloat where waters flow
zzzzzz

[chorus]
Breezes carry secrets far
Underneath the evening star
iiiiiiii  

[verse 2]
Gentle waves in harmony
Echoing eternity

[bridge - reflective]
Soft hums of the night
Zephyr's gentle flight
Ahhhhh oooo

[outro - fading light]
iiiiiiii
oooooo
