lyrics = [intro - serene echoes]
wooo aaaaa

[verse 1 - City Lights]  
Neon dreams in the night,  
soft whispers in the rain,  
echoes drift through the lanes,  
hearts find their refrain.  
ooooo

[Pre-Chorus - Harmony Flow]  
Gentle rhythm, pulse like tides,  
we ride the wave, no divides.  
iiiiii

[Chorus - Haven Echoes]  
In the city's heartbeat, we find,  
a haven where souls align.  
wooooooo

[Bridge - Twilight Glow]  
Through the shadows, light will guide,  
in this haven, we confide.  
ahhhh

[outro - fading whispers]  
Echoes linger, softly fade,  
night embraces the serenade.  
ooooo iiiii]
