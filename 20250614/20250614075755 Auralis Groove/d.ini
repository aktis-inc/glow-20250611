In the city of light, where shadows dance
Vibrant dreams weave through the trance

Tradition whispers, future calls
Dancing echoes, through the halls

Auralis beats, with life anew
Melodies blend, the old and true

Through the neon, heartbeat pounds
In this groove, all souls unbound

Stories told in beats and rhymes
In this city, beyond all times

Auralis, whispers in the night
Dreams and beats, take flight
