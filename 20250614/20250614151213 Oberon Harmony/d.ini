lyrics = [intro - Forest Awakening]

[verse 1 - Sunlight Dance]
In the morning light, whispers of dawn
Through the trees, melodies drawn
ooooo iiiii

[chorus - Heartfelt Embrace]
With each note, the forest sighs
Harmony in the sky
iiii ooo

[bridge - Serene Path]
Steps on leaves, soft and slow
Nature's song, gentle flow
ahhhhhh

[outro - Oberon Harmony]
Fade into the gentle breeze
Echoes of the forest's peace
oooo iiiii
