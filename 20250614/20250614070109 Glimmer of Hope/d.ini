lyrics = [intro - Soft Glow]
whispers in the rain
gentle pulse beneath the pain
ooooooo

[verse 1 - City Shadows]
Streets echo dreams lost and found
Within the noise, a silent sound
Through the night, hope unwinds
A glimmer in troubled times
zzzzzz

[Chorus - Flicker of Light]
oooooo
In the dark, we find our way
Through the storm, we'll see the day
iiiiiiiiii

[Bridge - Resilience]
In the whispers of the night
Strength in shadows, hidden light
ahhhh shhhhh

[verse 2 - Echoed Steps]
Walking paths of the unknown
Every step, seeds of hope sown
In the quiet, strength is shown

[outro - Glimmer of Hope]
soft echoes fade
whispers linger in the shade
oooo ooo
