lyrics = [intro - Fiesta Call]
(trumpet fanfare)  

[verse 1 – Candlelight Dance]
Guitars sing beneath the stars  
Voices rise like a thousand dreams  
ooooo iiiiiiiii  

[Pre-Chorus – Moonlit Paths]  
(accordion swell)  
Hearts entwine, a melody  
Guiding feet on ancient stone  

[Chorus – Illume Serenade]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii ooooooo  
Dance, the night is young, love shines bright  

[Bridge - Festive Embrace]  
Colors swirl, the world ignites (ole!)
In this moment, we belong (oh-oh!)
Aaaaaa eeeeeee  
[cheers and laughter]

[verse 2 – Echoes of Tradition]
Trumpets call, the rhythm flows  
Stories told in every note  

[Outro - Night's Embrace]  
[soft guitar strum]  
Underneath the moon's warm glow  
The serenade whispers low  
ooooo iiiiiiiii  
[fade out with gentle applause]
