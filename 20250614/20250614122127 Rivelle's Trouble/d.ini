lyrics = [intro - Echoing Steps]
ooooo  

[verse 1 – Shimmering Hope]  
In the city lights, shadows whisper  
ooooo iiiii   
Chasing dreams, heartbeats quicken  

[Pre-Chorus – Pulsing Sparks]  
Beneath the stars, we find our truth  
Emotions rise, like a wave of youth  

[Chorus – Rivelle's Echo]  
Trouble found in the night, iiiii  
Running wild, hearts ignite  
ooooo  

[Bridge - Luminous Dream]  
Midnight skies, secrets unfold  
Every moment, a story told  
shhhhh  

[outro - Fade to Dawn]  
In the cityscape, echoes remain  
Rivelle's Trouble, a fleeting refrain  
ooooo iiiii
