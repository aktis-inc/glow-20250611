oooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiii

[verse 1 - Vibrant Steps]  
Streets alive, lights dance  
Tradition whispers, modern glance  
Colors blend, hearts ignite  
oooooo  

[Chorus - Glimra Horizon]  
woooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiiiii  
City's pulse, beats align  
Joyful echoes, horizons shine

[Bridge - Rhythmic Flow]  
Dhol beats, footsteps follow  
Melodies weave through tomorrow  
Ahhhhhhh  
[echoed laughter]

[verse 2 - Urban Dream]  
Neon glow, night unfolds  
Stories old, yet untold  
Rhythms merge, dreams take flight

[glitch build-up]  
shhhhhhhh ooooo  

[distorted whisper] journey… vibrant… endless… (oo-yeah!)

[outro - Horizon Fade]  
oooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiii
