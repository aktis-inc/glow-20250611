lyrics = [intro beat]
(Spoken) Yo, step into the light, the city's alive
(Male Rap) Fast lanes, bright dreams, all in the night

[verse 1 – Rising Pulse]
Concrete echoes, dreams on the rise
Neon whispers, under the skies
Chasing beats, catching the breeze
Urban symphony, set it free
aaaaa

[Pre-Chorus – Vibe Shift]
(Spoken) Feel it move, feel it groove
(Male Rap) Streets awake, they never lose
wooooooo  
iiiii

[Chorus – Mirthwave]
(Female Rap) Mirth in the air, electric flair
(Male Rap) Rhythms collide, we own the night
ooooooooo

[Bridge - Urban Flow]
(Male Rap) City lights, we're on the go
(Female Rap) Beats collide, let it flow
vvvrrrrr

[verse 2]
(Male Rap) Pulsing beats, heart's desire
(Female Rap) Urban jungle, rising higher

[glitch build-up]
sssssshhh oooo

[Outro - Neon Echo]
(Spoken) Let the mirthwave guide your soul
(Male Rap) Into the future, we roll
