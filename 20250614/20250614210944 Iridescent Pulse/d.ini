lyrics = [intro]
(Spoken) Yeah, you know what's up  
(Beat kicks in)

[verse 1 - Neon Streets]  
Cruisin' through the city lights, vibe so right  
Got that iridescent glow, shining through the night  
Bass hits hard, boom-bap in my veins  
Rhymes so slick, never playin' games

[Pre-Chorus - Electric Surge]  
Feel the pulse, it's electric, can't deny  
Neon dreams in the sky, we fly  
ooooooo  
ahhhh

[Chorus - Urban Flow]  
City's alive, can you feel the beat?  
ooooo  
Pulse through the streets, it's a rhythmic feat

[Bridge - Graffiti Echoes]  
Spray paint dreams, colors collide  
This urban canvas, where we reside

[verse 2 - Rhythmic Bounce]  
Step by step, we own the night  
Echoes of laughter, under streetlight  
Words flow fast, like a river of sound  
In this concrete jungle, freedom's found

[drop]  
Boom boom ooooo  
ahhhhhh

[outro - Iridescent Pulse]  
Feel the rhythm, let it set you free  
iiiiiiiii  
In the city's heart, where we long to be
