lyrics = [intro - forest whisper]
(Flute and soft percussion)  
oooooo  
iiiiiiii

[verse 1 - Nature's Call]
In the heart of green, whispers unfold  
Song of the earth, stories retold  
zzzzzzhhhhh

[Chorus - Tarim Symphony]
oooooo  
Echoes of the land, ancient and grand  
iiiiiii

[bridge - Serene Passage]
Through the leaves, a gentle breeze  
Mystic paths, where spirits please  
ahhhhh  
[echoed breath]

[verse 2 - Wilderness Dance]
Rhythms of the wild, untamed and free  
Nature's embrace, a timeless sea  
oooooo

[outro - Calm Descent]
(sounds of nature fade)  
ooooo iiiii aaaa  
[soft flute melody]
