oooooo aaaa

[verse 1 – Rhythmic Flow]  
Sunlight dances on the strings  
Melodies weave through the breeze  
Hearts beat in sync, in harmony  
Energies collide, creating dreams  
yaaa oooooo

[Pre-Chorus – Uplift]  
Rising tides of sound  
Echoes all around  
oooo iiiii

[Chorus – Lyris Harmony]  
Together we rise  
In a sea of lights  
oooo  
lalalala

[Bridge - Dynamic Shift]  
Waves of joy, we ride  
Euphoria, our guide  
aaaa ooo

[verse 2 – Melodic Journey]  
Colors blend in the night sky  
Every note a whispered sigh  
Vibrations carry us high  
In this symphony, we fly  
zzzzz

[outro - Harmonic Fade]  
oooo iiiiii  
Echoes linger, softly fade
