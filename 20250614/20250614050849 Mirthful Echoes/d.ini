[verse]

Rhythms of the city breathe  
Traditions echo in the heart  
Vibrant colors paint the night  

[Pre-Chorus – Cultural Fusion]  
ooooo  
iiiiii  
Past and present dance as one  

[Chorus – Echoes of Mirth]  
wooooooo  
lively voices call and respond  

[Bridge - Harmony of Streets]  
Melodies weave through busy lanes  
Energy pulses, alive in veins  
ahhhhhh shhhhhh  

[verse 2]

Stories whispered through the air  
Every beat a tale to share  
Connection in the vibrant flare  

[glitch build-up]  
shhhhh oooo  

[outro - Mirthful Echoes]
