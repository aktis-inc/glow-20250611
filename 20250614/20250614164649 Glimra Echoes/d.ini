[verse 1 – Temple Whispers]
Silent winds carry tales
Rivers flow like time's embrace
oooooo

[Chorus – Echoing Spirits]
Glimra calls, through the mist
Hearts align, spirits lift
iiiiiiii

[Bridge – Sacred Flow]
Tabla beats, life unfolds
Flute's caress, softly told
shhhhhhh

[outro – Eternal Peace]
Glimra fades, whispers stay
In the light, we find our way
oooo aaaaa]
