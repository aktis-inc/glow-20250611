lyrics = [intro - Soft Glow]
ooooo oooooo  
gentle strum, light heartbeats

[verse 1 - Memory Frame]  
Captured moments in the light  
A whisper of time, held so tight  
Silent echoes in our eyes  
Stories told, where love abides

[Pre-Chorus - Echoed Past]  
ooooo  
In the pages of our days  
Every heartbeat finds its place  

[Chorus - Heart's Lens]  
ooooo oooooo  
In a photograph, we stay  
Forever young, in yesterday

[Bridge - Timeless Whisper]  
Fading edges, timeless glow  
In each shadow, love we sow  
ahhhhh iiiiiiii

[outro - Fading Light]  
Captured light, never fades  
In the heart, love cascades  
ooooo
