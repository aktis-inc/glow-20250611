[verse 1 – Rhythmic Dance]
In the heart of the storm, whispers rise  
Tradition dances with electric skies  
ooooo

[Chorus – Quorra's Call]
Feel the pulse of ancient drums  
Echoes of time, where the spirit hums  
iiiiiiiiiii

[Bridge – Ethereal Interlude]
Floating on dreams, vibrant and bold  
Stories untold, in rhythms unfold  
shhhhhh

[verse 2 – Whispers of Time]
Voices blend, in harmony’s grace  
Past and present, a timeless embrace  
zzzzzz

[outro – Fade to Silence]
