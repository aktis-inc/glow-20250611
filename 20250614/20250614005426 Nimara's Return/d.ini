lyrics = [intro - gentle keys]
(Soft hum) Night falls, whispers in the air
(Melodic echo) Love's shadow, lingering here
oooooo
iiiiiiiiiiii

[verse 1 – City Lights]
Golden streets, memories unfold
In every heartbeat, stories told
Through the glass, I see your face
Lost in time, a fleeting embrace
sshhhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Heart's Echo]
Soft glow, the city's breath
Between the lines, no regret
oooooo
iiiiiiiiiiii

[Chorus – Soul's Return]
wooooooo
Feel the pulse of yesterday
In the rhythm of the night

[Bridge - Twilight Reverie]
The night sings, a gentle refrain
Whispers of love, soft as rain
Ahhhh shhhhhh
[echoed sigh]

[verse 2]
Steps retraced, beneath the stars
Every moment, ours to guard
In the silence, echoes remain

[outro - Nimara's Return]
oooooo
iiiiiiiiiiii
Fading light, dreams persist
In the shadows, of the mist]
