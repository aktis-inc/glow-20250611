[verse 1 â€“ City Glow]
Neon signs whisper in the dark  
The city breathes to its own spark  
oooooo  
iiiiiiii

[chorus â€“ Europulse Drive]  
Feel the rhythm, catch the light  
Dancing through the endless night  
wooooooo  
oooooo  

[bridge â€“ Electric Dreams]  
Streets alive with every beat  
Our footsteps echo, oh so sweet  
ahhhhhh  
shhhhhhhh

[verse 2]
Every corner sings a song  
In this city, we belong  
ooooooo  

[outro â€“ Fade to Neon]  
In the glow, we find our way  
Dalis pulse, night turns to day  
oooooo  
iiiiiiii
