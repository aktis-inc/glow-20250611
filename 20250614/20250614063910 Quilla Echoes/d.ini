oooooo  
iiiiiiii

[verse 1 – Mountain Echoes]  
Whispers in the peaks  
Rivers weave through dreams  
Ancient tales unfold  
In shadows and streams  
aaaaaa  

[chorus – Heritage Flow]  
oooo  
Rhythms of the earth  
Songs of the sky  
Connecting past and now  
Never asking why  
iiiiii  

[bridge – Cultural Thread]  
Tradition's gentle call  
In every heart and breath  
Stories never fall  
In life and beyond death  
ssssss  

[verse 2]  
The wind carries voices  
Through valleys and time  
Echoes of choices  
In a rhythmic chime  
oooo  

[outro - Fading Light]  
iiiiiiii  
ooooooo  
[soft echo]
