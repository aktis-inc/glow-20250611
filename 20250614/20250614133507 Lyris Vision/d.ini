wooooo  
iiiiii

[verse 1 – Hidden Echoes]  
Invisible trails, city hums  
Lights dance, shadows play  
Beats resonate, heart's drum  
Silent whispers, night sways

[build-up – Electric Tension]  
oooooo  
zzzzzzzz  
Pulsing rhythm, rising high  
Energy flows, never shy

[Chorus – Lyris Vision]  
ooohh  
iiiiii  
Vision ignites, unseen flight  
In the glow, dreams ignite

[bridge – Resonant Waves]  
Sound waves collide, echoing dreams  
Through the haze, reality seems  
Ahhhh zzzzzz  
[soft glitch]

[outro – Fading Light]  
Disappearing into the night  
Lyris Vision, hidden sight  
oooooo  
aaaaaa]
