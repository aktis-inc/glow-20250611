lyrics = [intro – Soft Echoes]
piano whispers, gentle guitar strokes

[verse – Vesper's Call]  
In the night, stars start to sing  
Memories dance on silver strings  
Vesper's glow, a quiet embrace

[Pre-Chorus – Gentle Resonation]  
oooooo  
iiiiiiii  
Heartbeats echo, soft and true  
Moments linger, between me and you

[Chorus – Timeless Serenade]  
oooooo   
Vesper's song, a lullaby  
In the silence, we both fly

[Bridge – Embrace the Night]  
Melodies weave through the air  
In the moonlight, dreams laid bare  
ahhhhhh  
shhhhh

[outro – Whispered Memories]  
guitar fades, as stars align  
In the quiet, love's design  
oooooo
