lyrics = [intro - festive call]

[verse 1 - Rhythmic Dance]
Colors swirl in the night air
Celebration echoes in heartbeats
Flutes whisper tales of old
Dholak speaks the language of joy
oooooo

[chorus - Cultural Pulse]
Traditions weave the melody
Dance with the rhythm of the past
High above, stars twinkle in tune
ooooo iiiiii

[bridge - Ethereal Journey]
Across the mountains, echoes call
Lost in the harmony of the land
Ancient voices, alive once more
ssshhhh oooo

[outro - Chara Melody] 
oooo aaaa oooo
Festive lights fade into the dawn
