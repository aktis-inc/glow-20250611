lyrics = [intro - City Awakens]
whisper of rain... gentle hum...  

[verse 1 – Twilight Wanderer]  
In shadows of the neon glow  
Steps echo in the night's flow  
Heart whispers tales untold  

[chorus – Urban Monologue]  
ooooo iiiii   
Through city dreams, paths align  
In silence, stories intertwine  

[bridge – Reflection's Edge]  
Beneath the lights, truths unfold  
A journey in whispers retold  
ahhhhhhh 

[verse 2 – Echoes of Solitude]  
Streets sing of yesterdays  
In quiet, the spirit sways  
Lost in moments, found in gaze  

[outro - Dusk's Embrace]  
shhhhhh ooooo  
In the heart of the city, we find  
The Iriya Monologue, one of a kind
