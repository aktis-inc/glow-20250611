lyrics = [intro ocean waves]

[verse 1 – Island Dance]
Sunrise whispers through the breeze  
Guitar strums echo memories  
ooooo iiiiiii

[chorus – Rhythm of Quorra]
One drop, heart beats in time  
Soulful voices intertwine  
ahhhhhh ohhhh

[verse 2 – Sunset Glow]
Harmonies in the golden glow  
Steel drums play soft and slow  
zzzzz uuuuuu

[bridge – Tropical Dream]
Dance beneath the palm trees sway  
Feel the music, find your way  
oooooo aaaaah

[outro – Quorra Vibes]
Let the rhythm take you home  
In the waves, you’re not alone  
iiiiiii eeeeee
