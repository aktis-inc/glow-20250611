lyrics = [intro - City Pulse]
(female voice) Neon dreams, echo through the streets  
(male voice) Every step, a heartbeat, moving free  
ooooo iiiiiiiiii

[verse 1 – Urban Odyssey]  
Wheels glide on pavement, chasing light  
City whispers, secrets in the night  
Our laughter, a soundtrack in the air  
Together we fly, with time to spare  
zzzzzzz

[Pre-Chorus – Skyline Soar]  
[soft build-up]  
oooooo  
Under stars, we find our way  
Every moment, a brand new day

[Chorus – Waver's Anthem]  
woooo  
iiiiiiii  
Neon roads, endless skies  
In this city, we rise

[Bridge - Horizon Shift]  
Forward we move, no looking back (alright!)  
Our journey's groove, our soundtrack track (ok!)  
ahhhhhhh shhhhhhh

[verse 2]  
Streetlights guide our timeless path  
In the echoes of our own laugh  
Each corner turned, a story unfolds  
In Waver's world, we're bold

[glitch build-up]  
shhhhh oooo  

[outro - Waver's Journey]  
(whispered harmony) Follow the sound… the beat… the light… (yeah-yeah!)  
[outro fade]
