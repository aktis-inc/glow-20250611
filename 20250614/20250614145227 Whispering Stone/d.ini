lyrics = [intro - Echoes]

[verse 1 - Stone Path]
In shadows, whispers breathe
Silence holds the echoes near
Time stands still, as we wander
Through the veils of yesterday
oooooo 

[Chorus - Whispering Stone]
Hear the stone's secret song
iiiiiiiii oooooo
Carved in silence, echoes belong

[Bridge - Misty Reflection]
Footsteps fade into the mist
Dreams linger in twilight's kiss
ahhhh shhhhhh

[verse 2 - Echoes Return]
Memories etched, in the stone
Voices linger, never alone
sssssshhhhh oooooooo

[outro - Fading Whispers]
In the quiet, secrets unfold
The stone whispers, stories untold
oooo
