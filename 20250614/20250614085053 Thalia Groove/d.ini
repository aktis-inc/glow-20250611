[verse 1 – Night Pulse]
Lights spin, shadows sway
Under Thalia's gaze, we play
oooooo iiiiiii

[Pre-Chorus – Electric Echo]
ooooo ahhhh
Vibrations through the floor
Every moment, we want more

[Chorus – Thalia's Dance]
woooo
Dance, dance, under the moon
Feel the rhythm, see it bloom

[Bridge – Neon Glow]
Colors blend, hearts align
In this groove, we find our time
ahhhh ooooo

[outro – Groove Fade]
ooooo iiiii
Thalia whispers, goodnight
Until the next sunlight
