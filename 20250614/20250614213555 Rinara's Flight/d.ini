[verse]

In the sky, where sun meets dream  
Golden wings with silent gleam  
ooooo iiiiii  

(pre-chorus - Ascend)

Heartbeats pulse with ancient lore  
Through the clouds, forevermore  
aaaa eeeee

[chorus - Dance of the Sparrow]

Sway with time, the world below  
In the wind, we find the flow  
iiii aaaa  

[bridge - Ethereal Glide]

Tradition whispers in our ear  
Future calls, we have no fear  
shhhh wooooo  

[verse 2]

Colors blend, horizon's line  
In this dance, we redefine  
ooooo iiiii  

[outro - Flight's End]

Echoes soft, in twilight's song  
Golden sparrow, where you belong  
oooooo]
