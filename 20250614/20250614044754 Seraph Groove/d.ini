lyrics = [intro beat]

[verse 1 – City Pulse]
Streetlights flicker, shadows dance
Voices echo in the night
Steps syncopate with the beat
Hidden tales unfold in sound
oooooo

[Chorus – Neon Dream]
wooooooo
Rhythms collide, secrets untold
Neon dreams in the heart of stone

[verse 2 – Urban Flow]
Concrete jungle breathes in time
Echoes of hustle, whispers of shine
Life's a rhythm, a dance in disguise
Paths cross in a maze of light
iiiiiiiii

[Bridge – Electric Tide]
Pulse of the city, electric glide
Waves of sound in the urban tide
Ahhhhhh shhhhhh

[Outro – Seraph Groove]
Lost in the groove, the city's song
In the rhythm, we belong
wwwwwoooooo]
