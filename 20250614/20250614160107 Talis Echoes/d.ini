[verse - Ancient Echoes]  
Tales of old, whispered on the wind  
Sands of time, stories left behind  
oooooo aaaaaa iiiii

[Chorus - Desert Dreams]  
Mirages dance, under moonlit skies  
Echoes call, through the night  

[bridge - Time's Lament]  
Lost in the echoes, of forgotten lore  
Mystery's embrace, forevermore  
shhhhhh ooohhhh

[outro - Ethereal Fade]
