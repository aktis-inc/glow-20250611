ooooo

[verse - Wyrde's Call]
In the sky, the colors weave  
Mushroom dreams take their leave  
Floating islands, whispering light  
Through the echoing night

[Chorus - Flight of Wonder]
wooooo  
iiiiii  
A journey beyond stars  
Mysteries like scars

[Bridge - Surreal Drift]
Soundscapes unfold, vast and wide  
Wyrde's gaze, cosmic tide  
ahhhhhh

[outro - Ethereal Fade]
Sonic waves, gently glide  
To the realms where echoes hide
