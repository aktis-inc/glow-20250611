[verse 1 – City Pulse]  
Lights flash, shadows chase  
Through the maze, heart's race  
ooooooohhhhhh  

[chorus – Neon Drive]  
One way, or another I'll find  
The thrill, the chase, the unwind  
iiiiiiiii  

[verse 2 – Electric Beat]  
Footsteps echo, streets alive  
Night's pulse, where dreams thrive  
zzzzzzzzhhhhhh  

[bridge – Midnight Shift]  
Neon whispers, guiding light  
Through the dark, vibrant sight  
Ahhhhhh ahhhhh  

[outro – Tarian Pursuit]  
The city's beat, a rhythm true  
Tarian's chase, forever new  
oooooo aaaaaaa
