lyrics = [intro - Gentle Breeze]
wooo oooooo

[verse 1 – Echoes of Time]
In the sunlit glow, shadows play
Memories linger, fade away
Silent whispers, tales untold
In the stillness, moments unfold

[Pre-Chorus – Time's Embrace]  
oooooo  
Each beat, a heartbeat, in time's embrace
Unraveling the threads, a gentle trace

[Chorus – Reverie]  
iiiiii aaaahhh  
Lost in a reverie, where dreams collide
In the echoes of the past, we glide

[Bridge - Whimsical Drift] 
Colors swirl, in the mind's eye
A canvas painted with the sky  
ahhhh ooooo

[verse 2]
Steps we take, on paths unknown
In the quiet hum, seeds are sown
A dance of light, in twilight's glow

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[outro - Cadenza Reverie]
In the symphony of life, we find our way  
oooooo iiiiiii
