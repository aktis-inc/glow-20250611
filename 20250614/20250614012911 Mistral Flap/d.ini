[verse 1]
Breezes whisper, colors dance
In a world where dreams fly fast

[Pre-Chorus - Rising Pulse]
As we ride the digital stream
Together we chase the gleam
iiiiii

[Chorus - Mistral Flap]
oooo joy in the air
iiiiii we glide so fair

[Bridge - Neon Dream]
Glowing paths, we find our way
In this realm, we choose to play
woooo

[verse 2]
Skies unfold, new stories start
In this beat, we share our heart
oooooo

[outro - gentle fade]
oooo iiiii
