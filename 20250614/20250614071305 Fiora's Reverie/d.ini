[verse]
The moon whispers secrets
Through silken threads of light
In the stillness, a voice
Guides the wandering soul

[chorus]
Oooooo
Fiora's dream, a lullaby

[bridge]
Sitar strings weave
In patterns of stars
Tabla echoes, heartbeats
In harmony with night

[outro]
Soft winds carry
Ancient tales, unspoken
Fiora's reverie
In the heart of night]
