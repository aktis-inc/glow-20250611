iiiiii

[verse 1 – Ishara Dance]
In colors bright, we find the path
Echoes of laughter, songs of the past
Sitar sings, the tablas crash
A moment that will forever last

[chorus – Celebration Call]
ooooo  
Dance to the rhythm of the heart
oooooo
Where every beat is a brand new start

[bridge – Festival Echo]
A tapestry of sound and light
In this journey, we take flight
Ahhhhhh  
(sssshhh) whispers of the night

[verse 2 – Timeless Journey]
A story woven in melodies
Traditions blend with modern dreams
The dance floor calls, the heart redeems
In every step, a timeless theme

[outro – Ishara's Call]
oooooo iiiiii
The journey flows, the music's embrace
iiiiii
In Ishara's dance, we find our place
