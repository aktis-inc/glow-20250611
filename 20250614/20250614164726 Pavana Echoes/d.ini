ooooo aaa iiiii

[verse - Tranquil Waves]
In the stillness of dawn's embrace
Echoes of wisdom call
Through stone and mist, we trace
Paths where shadows fall

[chorus - Serenity Flow]
ooooo
Chanting through veils of time
Harmony in every line
iiiiii

[bridge - Ethereal Dance]
Soft whispers in the breeze
A melody of ancient trees
oooooo ahhhhhh

[outro - Pavana Echoes]
Resonant heartbeats fade
In twilight's gentle shade
oooo iiiii aaaa
