(echoing whispers) Subah dhundha, pukaaraa  
oooooo  
iii

[verse 1 â€“ Gentle Light]
Morning seeks through misty haze  
Calling softly, tender ways  
In the evening, shadows play

[Pre-Chorus â€“ Whispers Calling]  
[soft echo]
oooo  
iiii  
Heartbeats echo, nightâ€™s embrace  
Gentle whispers, time and space

[Chorus â€“ Yara's Serenade]  
wooooo  
aaaaaa  
Feel the night, hear the call  
In this moment, we are all

[Bridge â€“ Ethereal Echo] 
Softly spoken, dreams align  
Twilight whispers, loveâ€™s design  
Ahhhh  

[outro â€“ Fading Light]
Subtle echoes, fade away  
In the stillness, we will stay  
shhhh ooo]
