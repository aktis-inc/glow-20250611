lyrics = [intro - Whispers of the Wind]
(soft echoes) The night hums softly  
(soft echoes) Bliss in the air  
aaaaaaa  
iiiiiiiiii

[verse 1 – Arrows in the Mist]  
Chubby cherub's tale untold  
Gliding through the clouds of gold  
Silent wings across the sky  
A gentle nudge, a lover's sigh  
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Ethereal Pulse]  
whispers float  
oooooooooo  
In the dance of dusk and dawn  
Arrows weave where hearts belong

[Chorus – Blissful Flight]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiiiiaaaa

[Bridge - Mystical Charm]  
In the glow of neon hearts  
Cupid's touch, no fear imparts  
Ahhhhhh shshshsh  
[echoed breath]

[verse 2 – Beyond the Bow]  
Mystic melodies unfold  
In this dance of young and old  
Cupid's aim, so true, so bold

[outro - Blissful Arrows]  
ssshhhh oooo  
[echoing laughter]
