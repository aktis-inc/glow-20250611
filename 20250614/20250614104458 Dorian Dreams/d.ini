lyrics = [intro - echoing city sounds]

[verse 1 – Neon Reflections]
Under the glow, shadows keep my secrets  
Lost in the rain, whispers of past regrets  
oooo

[chorus – Heartbeat Pulse]
Dreams collide in the night, chasing after time  
iiiiii aaaaa  
Feelings unfold, like stories left untold  

[verse 2 – Midnight Thoughts]
Gazing at stars, promises we never kept  
In the silence, echoes of memories swept  
shhhhhhhhh  

[bridge – Soul's Lament]
I drift through the night, searching for signs  
Each drop a reminder, of the tears I've cried  
ooooo iiiiii

[outro – Dorian Dreams]
Fade into darkness, with hopes that gleam  
In the city of whispers, I find my dream  
ooooo
