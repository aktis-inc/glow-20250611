[verse 1 – Dancing Shadows]
Talim rises with the sun
Echoes of joy, the beat begun

Dance in circles, under the sky
Feel the rhythm, spirits high

Tradition meets the modern tune
Under the bright festival moon

Claps and laughter, fill the air
Talim's story, we all share

aaaa oooh
The night whispers, Talim's echo lingers
