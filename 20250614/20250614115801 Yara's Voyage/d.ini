[Swelling Strings]  
The sea whispers tales of yore  
ooooo  
[verse - Epic Call]  
Across the waves, Yara sails  
With dreams larger than the gales  
shhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus - Rising Tide]  
ooooooo  
Through storm and calm, brave and bold  
Every legend must unfold  
iiiiiiii

[Chorus - Hero's Anthem]  
ooooooo  
In the heart of the tempest, he stands  
With destiny in his hands

[Bridge - Tempest's Heart]  
The horizon calls, a siren's song  
In the night, where dreams belong  
ahhhhhhhhh

Stars guide the way, a dance with fate  
In the echoes of the sea, we celebrate

Sail on, Yara, into the night  
Where courage meets the morning light  
ooooooo]
