lyrics = [intro shimmer]
Dance in the moonlight, stars align  
Rhythms of the heart, ancient and new  
oooooo iiiiiiiii  
[verse 1 - Celebration]  
Tradition whispers in the breeze  
Every step, a story told  
Colors blend, a tapestry  
iiiiiii ooooo  
[Chorus - Joyful Union]  
Together we rise, in harmony  
Echoes of laughter, filling the night  
wooohoooo  
[Bridge - Fusion Flow]  
Old meets new, a dance of time  
Hands entwined, spirits fly  
ahhhhhh  
[verse 2]  
In the pulse of the city, dreams awaken  
Melodies weave through every soul  
Dance in the echoes of our past  
[glitch build-up]  
shhhhh ooo  
[outro - Tirion Groove]
