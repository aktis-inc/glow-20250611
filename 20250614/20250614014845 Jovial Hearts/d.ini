lyrics = [intro - Gentle Waves]
oooo ahhhh

[verse 1 ‚Äì Whispered Promises]  
In the calm, we find our place  
Hands entwined, hearts in grace  
mmmm ooooo

[Pre-Chorus ‚Äì Soft Glow]  
A gaze that speaks, no words needed  
In this moment, love is seeded  
ahhhh iiiii

[Chorus ‚Äì Jovial Hearts]  
Together we soar, oh how we fly  
In the twilight, you and I  
ooooooo

[Bridge - Eternal Ties]  
Bound by stars, in endless night  
Our love a beacon, shining bright  
ssssshhhhhh iiiii

[verse 2 ‚Äì Embraced by Time]  
Through the days, and all the years  
We'll conquer doubts, face our fears  
oooo ahhhh

[glitch fade]  
whispered love‚Ä¶ eternal bond‚Ä¶ (ahhhh!)

[outro - Sunset Bliss]  
Together always, in this bliss  
A gentle touch, a tender kiss  
oooooo iiiiiii]
