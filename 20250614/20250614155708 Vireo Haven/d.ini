lyrics = [intro - gentle rain]

[verse 1]
In the city's glow, where shadows dance
iiii ooooo 
We find our place, hand in hand

[chorus - Warm Embrace]
oooooo
Beneath the city lights, 
A haven in the night

[verse 2]
Echoes of laughter, memories trace
oooooo iiiiiii
In every corner, a familiar face

[bridge - Belonging]
In the heart of the crowd, we stand alone
oooooohhhhh
Yet together, we’ve found our home

[outro - Fade into Light]
sshhh ahhhh
Vireo, our haven, where dreams take flight
