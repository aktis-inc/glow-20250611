lyrics = [intro - Dream Haze]
soft iiiiiiiii ooooooo

[verse - Twilight Whispers]
In the city's glow, shadows dance  
Soft echoes linger, in a trance  
Past and present, gently entwined  
In the quiet, peace we find  
shhhhhhh oooo

[chorus - Warm Embrace]  
oooooo  
Whispers of the night  
Guiding gentle light  
Vesper echoes call  
In the stillness, we fall

[bridge - Serene Drift]  
Floating through the haze, serene  
Lost in thoughts, unseen  
Ahhhh iiiiiiii

[outro - Fading Light]
As the night unfolds, softly  
Dreams and echoes, drifting free  
shhhhhh iiiii]
