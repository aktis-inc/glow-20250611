[verse 1]
Sitar whispers to the dawn
Echoes of ancient songs
Tabla taps a gentle rhythm
In the heart where dreams belong

[chorus]
ooooooo
Melodies soar, like Icarus in flight
iiiiii

[bridge]
Harmony of earth and sky
Flute sings a lullaby
Gentle waves of sound collide
In this tranquil, endless tide

[outro - Euphony Drift]
ahhhhhhhh
Sailing on a sea of sound
Euphony, where peace is found
