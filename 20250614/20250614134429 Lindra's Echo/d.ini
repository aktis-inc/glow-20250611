lyrics = [intro - festival awakening]
gggggg ooooo  

[verse 1 - Hillside Resonance]  
Di lembah, suara bergema  
Langkah kaki, tarian jiwa  
oooo aaaaa  

[Chorus - Spirit Dance]  
aaaaaaaaa  
Lindra, dengar panggilan kita  
Gema hati di udara  

[Bridge - Rhythm of the Heart]  
Keberanian datang, suara bergelora  
Dengan irama, kita bersatu  
ooooo iiiiiii  

[verse 2 - Echoing Joy]  
Di antara pohon, cerita terjalin  
Setiap detak, napas kehidupan  

[outro - Fading Festival]  
aaaaa ooooo  
Suara meredup, tapi jiwa tetap hidup
