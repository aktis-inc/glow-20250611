[verse]

Guitar strings weave through the night  
Voices rise in joyful flight  
oooooooh

In the heart of the city, we unite  
Dancing through the neon light  
iiiiiiiiiiii 

[bridge]
Clap your hands, feel the beat  
Every step, a story complete  
wooooooo

[outro]

Harmony fades as dawn appears  
Echoes linger in our ears  
oooooo aaaaa
