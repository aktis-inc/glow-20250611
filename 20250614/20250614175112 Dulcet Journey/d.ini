ooooo

[verse - River's Whisper]  
In the flow of life, I drift  
Gentle echoes, ancient gifts  
Sitar's call, a timeless lift  
aaaaah

[Chorus - Twilight Dance]  
Melodies weave through the night  
In harmony, we find our light  
oooo oooo

[Bridge - Ethereal Pulse]  
Tabla's rhythm, heartbeat's guide  
In this journey, dreams reside  
shhhh 

[outro - Dulcet Fade]  
Echoes linger, soft and slow  
In the twilight, we let go  
oooo iiiii
