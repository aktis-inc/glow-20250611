lyrics = [intro - city echoes]

[verse 1]
Streetlights flicker, shadows grow
In the city of dreams, where stories flow
X marks the spot, where legends rise
In the heart of Xylar, truth never hides
ooohhh

[Chorus - Boss Vibe]
ooooo
iiiiii
I am the boss, ruling the night
With every step, I claim my right

[Bridge - Echoes of Xylar]
Neon lights, they guide my way
In this urban jungle, I won't sway
zzzzzz

[verse 2]
Rhythms pulse beneath my feet
In the city of echoes, where worlds meet
Confidence reigns, in every beat
In the heart of Xylar, I won't retreat

[Outro - Fade to Night]
ooooo
iiiiii
In the city of dreams, my throne I keep
As night descends, in Xylar I sleep
