lyrics = [intro - rhythmic pulse]

[verse 1 - Emotional Waves]
In the city lights, hearts collide  
Silent whispers, echo inside  
oooooo

[Chorus - Breakup Beat]  
iiiiiiiiii  
Let the rhythm mend what’s broken  
Dance through words unspoken  
ahhhh

[Bridge - Fusion Flare]  
Tradition meets the modern beat  
Feel the pulse beneath your feet  
ooooo  

[verse 2 - Vibrant Heart]  
Colors blend, emotions sway  
In this groove, we find our way  
shhhhhh

[glitch build-up]  

[Pre-Chorus - Electric Emotion]  
iiiiiiii  
Through the night, we rise, we glow  
With each beat, our spirits flow

[Outro - Orion's Light]  
Dance with me, under the neon sky  
Together, we’ll let the past fly  
ahhhhhhhhh
