[verse]
Soft whispers in twilight air  
Hearts bound in timeless stare  
ooooo

[Pre-Chorus - Echoes of Love]  
iiiiiiii
In fields of dreams we wander  
Through memories we ponder  

[Chorus - Nostalgic Embrace]  
wooooooo  
Hand in hand, we dance  
In this eternal romance

[Bridge - Harmonium's Call]  
Silent vows in moonlight's glow  
Forever's promise, we both know  
ahhhhhh

[verse 2]
Stars above, our guiding light  
In your arms, the world feels right  
zzzzzzhhh

[outro - Fiora Dreams]
