lyrics = [intro soft]
gentle sound ooooo

[verse 1]
Walk the path, soft underfoot
Dreams unfold, under the sky
whispering breeze, gentle caress
iiiiii aaaaaa

[chorus]
Dulcet tones, journey calls
Heart in tune, with the earth's song
ahhhhhhh oooooo

[bridge]
Stars align, guiding light
In this moment, all is right
hhhhh zzzzz

[verse 2]
Steps in sync, with the rhythm
Feel the pulse, of life around
Every note, a gentle whisper

[outro]
oooooo iiiii
Peaceful heart, journey on
