[vibrant verse]  

Guitarras lloran historias  
Esquinas guardan secretos  

[pre-chorus - whispering tales]  
oooooo  
iiiiiiiiii

[Chorus – Mountain Echoes]  
Voces del pasado  
Cantan al viento  
eeyyyyyyy  
aaaaaaa

[bridge - Heartbeat]  
Sigue el compás del alma  
Ritmos que nunca cesan  

[outro - fading sunset]
