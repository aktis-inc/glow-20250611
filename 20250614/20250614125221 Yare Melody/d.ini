lyrics = [intro - soft shimmer]

[verse 1]  
In a world wrapped in sepia tones  
Gentle whispers of time gone by  
ooooo

[chorus - Vintage Echo]  
Hearts entwined in a melody  
Dancing softly through the night  
ooooo  

[bridge - Golden Hues]  
Every note a tender embrace  
Harmonies like a warm caress  
sssssshhhh  

[verse 2]  
Dreams woven in a tapestry  
Of love's sweet, gentle song  
ahhhhhh  

[outro - Fading Light]  
Lingering in the glow of moments  
Where echoes of love remain  
oooo oooooo
