ooooo iiiiii

[verse - Cultural Echoes]  
Traditional whispers weave through the night  
Rhythms dance with the city's heart  
Glimra breathes, alive in every beat

[Pre-Chorus - Fusion Pulse]  
ooooo aaaa  
Vibrations blend, worlds collide  
Every note a step in the dance

[Chorus - Spirited Ascent]  
iiiiiiiooo  
Lifted high by the sound  
The melody weaves its story

[Bridge - Neon Traditions]  
Colors fade into sound  
Echoes of the past, present, future  
ahhhh shhhhhh

[outro - Glimra Melody]  
ooooo eeee  
Tradition and modernity entwined  
A final note, a whisper of time]
