     (male voice) Harmonies of the land  
     (female voice) In every heart and hand

   [verse 1 – Unity's Call]  
   Rivers flow with ancient tales  
   Mountains echo, voices hail  
   We stand strong, hearts aligned  
   In the warmth of shared time

   Together we rise, under one sky

   Threads of gold, stories untold  
   Future unfolds, dreams we hold  
   ahhhhhh shhhhhh

   Winds of change, whispers past  
   Unity, a binding cast
