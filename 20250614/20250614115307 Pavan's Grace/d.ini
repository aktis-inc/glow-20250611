[verse - Soul's Whisper]
The dawn's embrace, gentle and soft
In the temple's heart, a sacred loft
ooooo ahhhh

[chorus - Graceful Flow]
Pavan's grace, in every breeze
Carrying whispers, of ancient trees

[outro - Eternal Peace]
A gentle hum, of the universe's hymn
In silence, the soul finds its rhythm

[fade]
