[verse 1 – Fusion Dance]
Sway beneath the banyan leaves
Whispers of the past, in rhythm 

[Pre-Chorus - Breath of Time]  
ooooo 
iiiiii
Echoes hold the world’s embrace
Harmony of new and old

[Chorus – Yonder Devatha]
wooooooo  
iiiiiiiaaaa
oooooo
Dance with the timeless breeze

[Bridge - Eternal Pulse] 
Steps align with cosmic flow
Tradition in a modern glow
Ahhhhh

[verse 2]
Paths untold, we wander free
Futures woven in history

[outro - Harmony Fade]
shhhh ooooo
