[verse]
Build the world with broken hands
Colors clash, dreams expand
ooooo

[Pre-Chorus - Rising]
Pieces fall, align the plan
Chaos reigns, yet we stand

[Chorus - Construct]
Brick by brick, we rise
Under stormy skies
iiiiii

[Bridge - Electric Surge]
Lightning strikes, ignite the core
Building dreams forevermore
zzzz

[verse]
Each design a story told
In this city, brave and bold

[outro - Fade to Silence]
Build, break, renew
Jorun leads, through and through
