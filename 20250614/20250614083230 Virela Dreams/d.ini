(Soft guitar strumming)  
mmmmmmm aaaaaaa  
[verse 1 ‚Äì Dreamscape]  
In the light of early dawn  
Whispers of a past unknown  
Every shadow tells a tale  
oooooooo  
[Pre-Chorus ‚Äì Gentle Breeze]  
Soft winds carry echoes far  
Hearts aligned like distant stars  
iiiiiiii  
[Chorus ‚Äì Virela Dreams]  
oooooo  
In this dreamscape we find peace  
Underneath the sky's release  
[Bridge ‚Äì Quiet Reflection]  
Gentle tides of time unfold  
Stories yet to be retold  
shhhhhhh  
[verse 2]  
Paths we've wandered, stories spun  
Underneath the rising sun  
Every note a thread of light  
[glitch build-up]  
aaaaaa  
[Outro ‚Äì Fading Light]  
oooooo  
Dreams we leave in dawn's embrace  
gentle sighs, a soft retrace  
[fade]
