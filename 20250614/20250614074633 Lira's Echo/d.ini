[verse]  
In the silence, whispers of the past  
Guitar strings, tales untold  
oooooo

[Pre-Chorus - Cultural Wave]  
Echoes dance through time and space  
Melodies weave, unseen threads  

[Chorus - Modern Harmony]  
wooooooo

Ancient rhythms meet the beat of now  

[Bridge - Timeless Flow]  
Traditions sway, future calls (come)  
Blending paths, music evolves (onward)

[echoed harmony]  

[verse 2]  
Stories carried on the wind  
Cultural notes, softly spin  
iiii iiiiiiiiiii  

[outro - Lira's Echo]

Echoes fade, but the song remains  
iiiiiii
