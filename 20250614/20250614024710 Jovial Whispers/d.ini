ooooooo  
soft iiiii

[verse 1 – Morning Echoes]
Under the sky, whispers fade  
Dreams slip through gentle hands  
Silent echoes of yesterday  
Caught in the light, we stand  

[Pre-Chorus – Timeless Dance]  
iiiiiiiiiiii  
Moments float, like leaves in flight  
Heartstrings play, soft and light  

[Chorus – Whispered Memories]  
oooooo  
Through my fingers, time flows  
Holding memories, as it goes  

[Bridge - Reflective Glow]  
Steps we trace, in golden hue  
Memories dance, ever true  
Ahhhhh

[verse 2]
Sunrise paints the world anew  
Shadows blend into the blue  
Fleeting moments, forever stay  
In the heart, where whispers sway  

[outro - Jovial Whispers]
