In the city where lights dance
Tradition beats with the future's glance

Ride the wave, let it take you high
Echoes of the past in the neon sky

Brass and beats, worlds collide
Dance with the rhythm, let it guide

Paths untold, stories unfold
In every beat, a tale retold

oooooo iiiii
Tradition and tomorrow, in harmony's gift
