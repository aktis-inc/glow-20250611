lyrics = [intro]
(whispered echoes) iiiaaa  
[verse]
Neon tides, they rise and sway  
In the city's heartbeat, we play  
oooooo  
[Pre-Chorus]
Floating whispers, through the night  
Every color, every light  
[Chorus]
wooooooo  
Feel the zephyr, feel the groove  
Dance with shadows, we move  
[Bridge]
Silent echoes, guide the way  
Through the dreams, where we stay  
[glitch build-up]  
shhhh oooo  
[outro]
(whisper) iiiii aaaaaa
