lyrics = [intro - Neon Rise]
(Soft synth) Pulsing lights, city dreams  
(Ambient hum) Echoes in the night  
oooooo  
iiiiiii

[verse 1 - Urban Voyage]  
In the city's glow, we fly  
Chasing dreams, reaching high  
(Melody glides) Through the sky  
Fiora guides, to the moon's sigh  
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus - Cosmic Pulse]  
[soft beat]  
oooooo  
Gravity fades, we rise  
Every beat, a new surprise

[Chorus - Lunar Dance]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Celestial Drift]  
I am the light, guiding through  
Path unknown, stars anew  
Ahhhhhh shshshsh  
[cosmic breath]

[verse 2 - Starbound]  
Leave the ground, we ascend  
Journey's path, never end  
Alive with every beat

[build-up - Astral Surge]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[outro - Fiora to the Moon]
