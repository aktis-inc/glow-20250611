Sunset glow, streets alive  
Melodies weave, hearts collide  
Dancing feet, laughter flows  
Echoes of joy, rhythm grows

City's heartbeat, vibrant sound  
In this dance, we are found  
oooooo oooo  
Jovial vibes all around

Neon lights, stories blend  
Rhythmic tales that never end  
Harmonies rise, spirits free  
Dance with us, come and see

Guitar sings, percussion calls  
Through the city, music falls  
Feel the groove, let it guide  
Join the journey, joyful ride
