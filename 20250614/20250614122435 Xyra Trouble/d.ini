lyrics = [intro echo]
(Synthesized voice) Neon whispers fill the air
(Synthesized voice) In shadows, I find my flair
ooooooo  
iiiiiiiii

[verse 1 – Night Stride]
Steps echo in the city glow
Paths cross where secrets flow
The rhythm of unsaid words grows
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Electric Pulse]  
[soft glitch]
oooooo
In the silence, truth unfolds
Each beat carries stories untold

[Chorus – Urban Echo]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Twilight Revel] 
I walk the line, choose my fight (tonight!)
In this maze, I find the light (alright!)
Ahhh shhhhh  
[echoed breath]

[verse 2]
In the rush, the heartbeats race
Every choice, a fleeting trace
Alive in the city’s embrace

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[distorted whisper] choices… echoes… unravel… (oo-yeah!)

[outro - Xyra Trouble]
