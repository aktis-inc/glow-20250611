lyrics = [intro - swirling chaos]

[verse 1 - City Pulse]
The skyline breaths, the city wakes
Underneath the neon haze
Fiora's call, the rhythm breaks
ooooo iiiiii

[Pre-Chorus - Electric Surge]
Echoes dance, in the night
Rising waves of electric light
zzzzz

[Chorus - Vortex Symphony]
Fiora's motion, in constant flow
Through the currents, we will go
iiiiii aaaa

[Bridge - Midnight Reverie]
Beneath the stars, whispers rise
The city hums, in lullabies
ahhhh oooo

[verse 2 - Unseen Paths]
Shadows play, on hidden streets
Fiora's song, the night repeats

[glitch build-up]
oooo iiiiii

[outro - Celestial Crescendo]
Rising tides, in the city's glow
Fiora's dance, the ultimate show]
