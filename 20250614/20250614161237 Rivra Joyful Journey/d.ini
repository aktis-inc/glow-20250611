(Flute melody) 
ooooo

[verse 1 - Lively Echoes]
Under the sun, colors collide
Dance in the wind, joy as our guide
oooo aaaah

[Pre-Chorus - Vibrant Steps]
Tradition whispers, stories unfold
Every beat, a tale retold

[Chorus - Joyful Chorus]
Rivra ooooo
Journey of dreams, living in streams

[Bridge - Harmony]
ooooo ahhhh  
Feel the rhythm, feel the soul
Life's a melody, let it control

[verse 2]
Daylight glows, hearts in bloom
Steps in sync, dispelling gloom

[outro - Festive Farewell]
oooh ooo  
Joyful echoes, forever remain  
In Rivra's joyful domain
