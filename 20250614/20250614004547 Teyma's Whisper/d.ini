(Soft piano) iiiiiiiii

[verse 1 – Tender Opening]
Whispers float on the breeze
Hearts entwined in silent ease
oooo aaaaa

[Pre-Chorus – Gentle Embrace]
Softly the night sings
Dreams in gentle wings
oooo yeaaaah

[Chorus – Heart's Whisper]
Teyma's light, a gentle call
In the stillness, we find all
iiiii oooooo

[Bridge – Love's Echo]
Every shadow, every light
Holds a promise in the night
ahhhhhh shhhhhh

[verse 2]
In quiet moments we find
The echoes of a love defined
ooooo eeeeee

[outro – Whisper's Fade]
Sailing on the dreams we weave
In Teyma's whisper, we believe
oooo aaaaaa
