lyrics = [intro - eerie whispers]

[verse 1]
Silent shadows weave in the night  
Echoes of a forgotten song  
The forest breathes a secret sigh  
A tale of darkness long

[Pre-Chorus - Building Tension]  
In the heart of the storm  
Where whispers become roars  
ooooo  
iiiiiii

[Chorus - Fylora's Call]  
Fylora's echo resounds  
Through the misty veils of time  
In silence, we are bound  
To the rhythm of the night  
oooooo  

[Bridge - Haunted Memories]  
Among the ancient trees, we roam  
Lost in echoes, finding home  
Aaaaaahhh  

[verse 2]
The moonlight guides our way  
Through paths of shadow and light  
In Fylora's embrace, we stay  
Till the break of dawn's first light

[Instrumental - Guitar Solo]

[outro - Echoing Silence]
wooooooo
shhhhhhh
