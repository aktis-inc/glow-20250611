lyrics = [intro - dawn whispers]

[verse]
In the quiet of the dusk  
Where shadows play and linger  
Ishani walks the ancient path  
With steps as light as whispers

[chorus]
ooooo  
iiiiii  
The spirit dances free  
Through realms of serenity

[bridge - twilight glow]
Bells echo in the valley  
A song of the ages, softly sung  
In every heart, a quiet calling  
Resonates where peace is sprung

[verse]
Mountains stand in silent watch  
Temples hum with stories old  
In the wind, the answers float  
To questions never told

[outro - dusk fade]
wooooooo  
ahhhhhhh  
Embrace the night, softly  
Ishani's journey, gently
