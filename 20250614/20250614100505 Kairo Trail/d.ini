lyrics = [intro twang]

[verse 1 – Desert Ride]
Through the neon sands we go
Twangin' strings and beats that flow
Ridin' high, no lookin' back

[chorus – Kairo Trail]
oooooo
Kairo Trail, where the future glows
Ride the rhythm, feel the flow

[bridge – Twang Echoes]
Desert winds whisper tales
In this land, legends prevail
Ahhhhhh ooooooo

[verse 2 – Lone Ride]
Stars above, guiding lights
In the night, we take flight
Twistin' paths, no end in sight

[chorus – Kairo Trail]
wooooo 
oooooo

[outro – Neon Fade]
Riding on, the trail we blaze
In this glow, lost in the haze
sshhhhhhh ooooo
