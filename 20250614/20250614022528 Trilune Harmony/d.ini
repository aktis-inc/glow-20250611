lyrics = [intro - gentle strum]

[verse 1 - Dust Road]
In the quiet fields where stories sleep  
Whispers of the wind, secrets they keep  

[chorus - Golden Horizon]  
oooooo  
iiiiiiiiii  
Where the sun meets the land, life begins anew  

[bridge - Heart's Echo]  
Silent stars above, guiding through the night  
Dreams of yesterday, shining bright  

[outro - Whispered Goodbye]  
oooo  
Softly fades the light, under Trilune's sky
