lyrics = [intro - cinematic swell]
[soft flute melody]  

[verse 1 - City Whispers]  
In the lights, dreams awaken  
Colors blend, futures taken  

[Pre-Chorus - Rhythmic Pulse]  
A journey beyond the skies  
Weaving tales in moonlit eyes  

[Chorus - Harmonious Flight]  
ooooooo  
iiiiiiii  
Dance with me, where dreams align  
Echoes of time, whispers divine  

[Bridge - Enchanted Path]  
Through the city, gleaming bright  
Chasing shadows, in the night  
ahhhhhhh  

[verse 2 - Dreamer's Call]  
Stories told in silent sighs  
In this world, where magic lies  

[outro - Quorra's Lullaby]  
[flute and strings fade]  
[soft vocal hum]  
ooooo iiiiiiiiii
