lyrics = [intro - City Pulse]
oooo zzzzz

[verse 1 – Streets Alive]
Basement echoes, alleys speak
Rhythms carved in ancient stone
My voice, a storm in the desert

[Chorus – Zephyr Groove]
ahhhh iiiiiii
Move with the breeze, city sings
Stories told in every beat

[Bridge - Urban Mirage]
Mirage of lights, a dance of shadows
iiiiii aaaaah
Echoes of home, heartbeat of stone

[verse 2]
Concrete rivers, flowing tales
Streetlights cast their spell
Oasis found in the sound

[outro - Fade to Beat]
ssssshhh woooooo
Zephyr's breath carries the groove
Into the night, into the soul
