[verse]
In the city where echoes play
Neon dreams light the way
ooooooo  
iiiiiiii

[Pre-Chorus]
Bassline surge, night unfolds
Electric pulse, stories told

[Chorus]
ooooo
iiiiiiiiiiiii

[Drop]
Elaris pulse, feel the night
oooooo

[Bridge]
Rhythm speaks, streets alive
Synth waves rise, we survive
ahhhhhhh

[verse 2]
Echoes dance on city walls
In the beat, the night calls

[outro]
Elaris pulse, melt away
ooooo
iiiiiiiiii
