lyrics = [intro - Soft Light]

[verse 1 - Glimmer of Hope]
Gentle whispers call my name  
Through the shadow, light breaks free  
iiiiiiiiii  
oooooo

[Pre-Chorus - Rising Faith]  
Lift my spirit, let it soar  
Every heartbeat, one with grace

[Chorus - Divine Embrace]  
oooo  
Hold me close, in Your light  
Glimmering, in endless night

[Bridge - Eternal Light]  
Your love's beacon, guides my way  
With each step, I find my faith  
ahhhh

[verse 2 - Journey of Grace]
Path of light before my eyes  
Guided by the sacred ties  
ssshhhh

[outro - Graceful Fade]  
In Your arms, I find my peace  
Glimmering in Your embrace
