lyrics = [intro festival sounds]

[verse 1 – Dawn Chorus]
Colors dance, under skies so wide
Rhythms pulse, like heartbeats alive
oooo ahhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Celebration Call]
Voices rise, in harmony's embrace
Every step, a story in the space

[Chorus – Lumina Journey]
Feel the light, in every beat
iiiiii aaaaaa
Let the music guide your feet

[Bridge - Echoes of Joy]
Tradition whispers in the breeze
New dreams carried on ancient seas
shhhh oooo

[verse 2]
Paths we tread, where past and future meet
In the dance, we find our way
zzzzz

[outro - Fade to Festival]
Harmony fades into the night
But Lumina shines, forever bright
