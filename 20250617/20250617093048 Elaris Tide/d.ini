[verse]
Elaris, the waves call softly
Guitar strings echo in the mist
Floating on the tide, we drift
Ooo eee ooo eee iiiii

[chorus]
Catch the breeze, ride with me
In a sea of dreams, we’re free
Ahhh ohh ahhh

[verse 2]
Colors swirl in the sunlit foam
Where the music meets the sea
Elaris, take me home
Waves of sound set me free

[bridge]
Flowing tides, gentle glide
Elaris guide us, side by side
Wooo aaahhh

[outro]
Echoes fade, the ocean sings
Elaris, where the melody clings
Ahhh ooo eee iiiii
