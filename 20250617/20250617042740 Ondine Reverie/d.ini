lyrics = [intro - Neon Glow]
whiiiiiii  
ooooooo

[verse - City Dreams]
In lights, we dance, forgotten tales  
Anime whispers, beyond the veil  
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus - Echoing Stars]  
(chiming echoes)
Through streets of dreams, we glide  
Every step, a magic ride  

[Chorus - Reverie Flight]  
iiiiiii  
oooooohhh  
Floating in the endless night

[Bridge - Whimsy Pulse]  
Neon hearts, they beat as one (ahh!)  
In our world, the journey's spun (ok!)  
Ahhh shhhhhhh  
[echoed laughter]

[verse - Hidden Paths]
Secrets weave through every lane  
In this dream, we all remain  
Too alive to be mundane

[outro - Ondine's Whisper]  
shhh ooo  
[soft fade out]
