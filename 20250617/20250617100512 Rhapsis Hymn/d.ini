[verse - call to light]
A spark ignites in the heart  
Colors dance in the sky  
Feel the world come alive  
In this moment, we're infinite

[Pre-Chorus - Rise]
oooooo iiiiii  
Lift your voice to the heavens  
Let the echoes carry you

[Chorus - Hymn of Joy]
woooooo  
Sing the song of the soul  
Euphoria takes control

Twirl beneath the starlight  
With every heartbeat, we rise

Feel the magic in your veins

Embrace the dawn's first light  
As the world awakens anew  
Together we shine brighter

[glitch build-up]

Dance among the stars  
In the symphony of night  
iiiiiii aaaaaa  
Echoes of a timeless hymn
