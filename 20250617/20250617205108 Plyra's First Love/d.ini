Vanda steps into the light  
First love, a spark ignites  
ooooo

Excitement in every glance,  
In his eyes, a shared chance  
Compassionate whispers tell  
Stories where both hearts dwell

[Pre-Chorus - Blissful Realization]  
ooooo  
Hand in hand, a gentle sway  
Feelings bloom, come what may  

[Chorus - Love's Embrace]

Vanda's world spins anew  
In love's vibrant hue  

[Bridge - Compassion's Dance]  
Every smile, a sweet grace  
In each moment, they embrace  
ahhhh ahhhh

[verse 2 - Joyful Journey]  
Laughter echoes in the breeze  
Together, hearts find ease  
ooooo iiiiii  

[outro - Harmony's Glow]  
Their love, a radiant glow  
In compassion, they both grow  
ooooo]
