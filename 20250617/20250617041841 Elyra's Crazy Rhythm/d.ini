[verse]
Guitars sing as heartstrings play  
Fields of gold, skies turn gray  
Elyra's dance, a wild embrace  
Echoes of a timeless chase  

[chorus – Crazy Rhythm]  
ooooo  
Feel the beat, can't stay still  
Elyra's rhythm, a joyous thrill  
iiiiii

[bridge – Twangy Heart]  
Sunset glow, a gentle sway  
In Elyra's world, we drift away  
ahhhh ooo  

[verse]
Footsteps echo, laughter's sound  
In this dance, we're unbound  
Guitar strum, a lover's call  
Elyra's rhythm, we give our all  

[outro – Fade to Fields]  
ooooo  
Elyra's heart, forever wild  
In her rhythm, we're beguiled  
iiiiii
