[synth echo]  
oooooo  
zzzzzzzhhhhh

[verse 1 – Night Surge]  
Pulses rise, the city's alive  
Rhythm flows, neon dreams ignite  
zzzzz

[Pre-Chorus – Electric Rush]  
Throbbing lights, endless night  
ooooooo  
The beat's a guide, no time to hide

[Chorus – Urban Beat]  
woooooo  
iiiiiiii  
Feel the pulse, let it roll  
Energy takes control

[Drop - Sonic Wave]  
shhhhhh

[Bridge – Digital Drift]  
Synth waves crash, paths untold  
In this night, lose control  
ahhhhhhhhh

[verse 2]  
Vibrations hum, the world a stage  
In this dance, we turn the page  
zzzzzz

[outro - Fade to Night]  
oooooo  
iiiiiiii
