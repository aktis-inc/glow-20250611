[verse]
The sun dips low, where dreams flow
Breezes whisper, secrets untold
ooooo aaaa

[chorus - Tropical Dream]
Neon nights, rhythm in flight
iiiiii ooooo
Dance slow, where the heart glows
ahhhh

[bridge - Island Echo]
Under stars, we find our way
Through the night, in gentle sway
ooooo iiiii

[outro - Fade to Calm]
Waves of light, softly ignite
ooooo ahhhh
