wwwooooooo

[verse 1 - Shadow Steps]
In the hushed embrace of night
Echoes whisper, hearts ignite
wwwwhhh

[Pre-Chorus - Soul's Dance]
Entwined in spectral grace
oooooo  
Our souls in gentle chase

[Chorus - Eternal Aria]
oooooo
iiiiiii  
Beneath the moon's soft glow

[Bridge - Phantom's Embrace]
Through time's shadowed corridors
Haunting notes, eternal scores
ahhhh  
oooooo

[verse 2 - Midnight's Echo]
In dreams, our spirits soar
A timeless dance forever more

[outro - Zephyr's Aria]
Shadows fade, yet echoes stay
In the theater where we play  
oooooo  
zzzzzz
