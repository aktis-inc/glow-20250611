lyrics = [intro – Whispered Realization]
(synth voice) twinkling lights, the city breathes
(soft echo) two souls align, unexpected

[verse 1 – Heartbeat Sync]
In the glow of city nights
A spark ignites, your eyes alight
Feel the pull, a gentle sway
Words unspoken, hearts convey
ooooo iiiii

[Pre-Chorus – Rising Pulse]
[soft build]
ooooooo
Tangled threads of fate entwine
In this moment, undefined

[Chorus – Jovial Hearts]
whooooo  
iiiiiiii
Love's first touch, a quiet storm
Finding rhythm, a new form

[Bridge – Electric Connection]
Silence speaks, a thousand words
Hearts that dance, untold worlds
Ahhhh zzzzz  
[echoed laughter]

[verse 2 – Shared Glances]
Distant echoes, close embrace
Hidden smiles, a tender chase
Feel the warmth, like rising sun
Two become, what was begun

[glitch build-up]
ssssshhhh ooooo

[outro – Dusk's Embrace]
Beneath the stars, where dreams ignite
In this dance, we take flight]
