lyrics = [intro - Gentle Prelude]
    [soft guitar strum]  
    ooooooo  
    [verse 1 - Calm Reflection]  
    In the hush of evening glow,  
    whispers of the breeze,  
    lull the soul to rest,  
    iiiiiiiii  
    [Pre-Chorus - Gentle Embrace]  
    [soft piano notes]  
    Serenade the heart,  
    with a tranquil touch  
    [Chorus - Serene Harmony]  
    ooooooo  
    [Bridge - Whispering Winds]  
    Breathe in the calm,  
    let it flow,  
    ahhhh  
    [verse 2 - Twilight Peace]  
    Stars begin their dance,  
    above the gentle stream,  
    dreams softly unfold  
    [outro - Fading Echo]  
    oooooo  
    [gentle fade]
