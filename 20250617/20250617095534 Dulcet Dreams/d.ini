lyrics = [intro - gentle rain]

[verse]

Soft whispers in the night  
Dreams weave through the light  

[chorus - soothing echo]

oooooo  
iiiiiiii

[bridge - neon reflections]

City's heart, a lullaby  
In the rain, we fly  

[verse]

Stories painted in the rain  
Heartbeats sync again

[outro - fading lights]
