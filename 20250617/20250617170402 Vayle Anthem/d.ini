ðŸŽµ "Udaan Hai Teri, Toh Darr Kaisa?" ðŸŽµ
(A motivational Hindi song script)

[Verse 1]
Jab andhiyaare chha jaaye,
Toh roshni tu ban jaa,
Gir ke bhi jo uth jaaye,
Wohi toh asli junoon paaye.

Sapnon ko tu haqiqat bana,
Raahein rokengi, par tu naa rukna,
Jitni badi ho deewar,
Utni zor se tu kood ke dikhana!

[Chorus]
Chalaa chal veer tu,
Na soch kya kahenge yeh jahaan,
Tere jazbaat mein hai aag,
Banaa le tu apni pehchaan!
Udaan hai teri, toh darr kaisa?
Tu aag hai, tu asar hai khaas!

[Verse 2]
Thokar mile toh muskaana,
Nafrat mile toh pyaar baantna,
Jeet sirf manzil nahi,
Raaste ko bhi jeet banana!

Mehnat ko ibadat samajh,
Thakaan ko tu medal bana,
Kal kisne dekha hai yaar,
Aaj ka tu sitara bana!

[Chorus Repeat]
Chalaa chal veer tu,
Na ruk kabhi, na mudh peeche,
Zameen se aasmaan tak,
Hai bas ek hi raasta â€” seedhe!
Udaan hai teri, toh darr kaisa?
Tu aag hai, tu asar hai khaas!

[Outro â€“ Spoken softly with music fading in background]
Har subah tu naya likh,
Khaali safha tu bhar de,
Zindagi ek geet hai,
Tu uski dhun ban ja...

lyrics = [intro]
(Softly spoken) Vayle whispers, rise beyond

[Verse 1]
Darkness shrouds, be the light  
Fall and rise, the true might  
Dreams to reality, make them fly  
Walls may block, but jump high

[Chorus]
March on, brave soul  
Don't heed the world's call  
Passion burns bright  
Craft your own sight  
Vayle lifts you, fear no more  
You are fire, you are unique

[Verse 2]
Smile at the fall, love at hate  
Victory isn't just the fate  
Hard work, a sacred trace  
Turn fatigue to a medal's grace

[Chorus Repeat]
March on, brave soul  
Never stop, never turn back  
From earth to sky  
There's one path â€” direct  
Vayle lifts you, fear no more  
You are fire, you are unique

[Outro â€“ Spoken softly]
Write anew each dawn  
Fill the blank page  
Life's a song  
Be its tune...
