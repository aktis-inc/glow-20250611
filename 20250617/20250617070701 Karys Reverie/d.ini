lyrics = [intro – Whisper of Dawn]
iiiiii oooooo  
[male voice] In the quiet morning light  
[female voice] Hearts speak in gentle whispers

[verse 1 – Echoes of Love]  
Softly, the world fades away  
In your eyes, I find my stay  
Tender moments, like the breeze  
Time pauses, hearts at ease  
oooooo iiiiii

[chorus – Karys Reverie]  
Together, we are a melody  
A gentle touch, a sweet symphony  
In this dream, we find our place  
Wrapped in each other's embrace  
wooooo iiiiii

[bridge – Heartstrings]  
Every note, a promise made  
In your arms, fears allayed  
Kiss the stars, feel the night  
In your love, I find my light  
zzzzzzhhhhh

[verse 2 – Serenity's Call]  
Through the shadows, we will glide  
With the moon, our eternal guide  
Whisper dreams, softly shared  
In your love, I am repaired  
oooooo

[outro – Dream's End]  
iiiiii oooooo  
[male voice] A love song, never-ending  
[female voice] With you, my heart's mending
