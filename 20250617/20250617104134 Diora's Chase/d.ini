lyrics = [intro - Neon Whispers]
(Whispered echoes) Through the glass, the lights call  
(Whispered echoes) Chasing shadows in the night  
ooooo  
iiiiiiii  

[verse 1 – Digital Mirage]  
Diora runs through the glow  
Reflections dance in her wake  
Signals pulse, guiding her path  
She's a shadow in the light  
zzzzzzhhhhhh  

[Pre-Chorus – Electric Pulse]  
[soft glitch]  
oooooooooo  
In the maze of luminous dreams  
Every step a beat of life  

[Chorus – Rhythmic Escape]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii  

[Bridge - Echoed Hues]  
She moves like a fleeting thought (go!)  
In the city's embrace (ok!)  
Ahhh shhhhhhh  
[echoed breath]  

[verse 2]  
Her path is a stream of light  
Trails of color in her wake  
Too alive to be unseen  

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[distorted whisper] speed… pursuit… awakening… (oo-yeah!)  

[outro - Diora's Chase]
