[verse]
In the gentle sway of time  
Whispers weave through the night  
Soft echoes of a distant past  
Serene dreams in flight  
shhhh aaaahhh

[chorus - light embrace]  
In the stillness, we find  
A melody of the mind  
ooooo  

[bridge - drifting thoughts]  
Floating in the quiet stream  
Lost in a tranquil dream  
iiiii iiiii

[outro - fading echoes]  
As the daylight softly goes  
In serene echoes, we repose  
ooooooo  
shhhh
