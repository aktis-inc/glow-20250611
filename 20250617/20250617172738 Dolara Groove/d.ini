ooooo  
[verse 1 – Island Dance]  
Sun-kissed waves, we move in time  
Laughter echoes, rhythm divine  
iiiiii

[Pre-Chorus – Sea Breeze]  
Waves crash, hearts sync  
Feel the beat, don't think  
ooooo

[Chorus – Dolara Groove]  
Dance, dance, under the moon  
Feel the magic, let it bloom  
ooooo

[Bridge – Sunset Glow]  
Colors blend, night takes flight  
In this groove, we find our light  
shhhhhhh

[verse 2 – Tropical Dream]  
Stars above, whispers below  
Dance with me, let feelings flow  
ooooo

[outro – Nightfall Echo]  
ooooo  
Night falls, but the groove remains  
Dance with the waves, break the chains]
