[soft wave]

[verse]
Dalam cahaya pagi
Kota berseri menyambut
Langkahku terhenti  
hmmmmm

[chorus]
oooooo  
Melody lembut  
Kalbu tenang dalam damai

[bridge]
Di antara menara
Harapan menyala,  
ooooo aaaaa

[verse]
Hati menemukan  
Cahaya di kejauhan  
Tempat damai abadi

[outro - Lumina's Journey]
