lyrics = [intro - percussive build]
dum-dumm dumm...
tarara ra raaa...
[drop - pulsing synth]
ooooooooooooooo

[verse 1 - flowing rhythm]
Green hills watch the morning mist
Sunlight catches on the Brahmaputra wave
Old stories hum beneath the new beat
Every footstep starts a sound

[Pre-Chorus - gathering energy]
The pulse is rising now
Feel the earth tremble lightly
ah ah ah ah ah

[Chorus - soaring melody]
Spark ignites the air!
The rhythm takes its hold
Spinning, spinning free
Every heart a drumbeat now
iiiya ya ya ya

[verse 2 - instrumental focus]
[flute solo with syncopated percussion]
du dut du dut

[bridge - reflective pause]
Just a moment holding still
Breathing in the fragrant air
Remembering the quiet song
Before the beat returns

[Drop - intense]
uuuuuuuuuuuuuu
[percussion explosion]

[Chorus - full force]
Spark ignites the air!
The rhythm takes its hold
Spinning, spinning free
Every heart a drumbeat now
iiiya ya ya ya

[outro - fading percussion and flute]
tarara ra ra ra....
dum dumm...
(fades)
