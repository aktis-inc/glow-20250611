ooooohhh wwww

[verse 1 – Whispering Echoes]
Strings that hum, tales untold
Heartbeats blend, in chords of gold
Breezes sing, the stories unfold
In this realm, where warmth is bold
mmmmmmm aaaaaa

[chorus – Soulful Embrace]
Rilac echoes, soothe the night
Gentle whispers, in the light
Every note, a tender flight
Softly guiding, through the night

[bridge - Serenity's Call]
In the quiet, dreams take shape
Melodies like silk, softly drape
Harmony's embrace, wide and deep
A gentle lull, as the world sleeps

[outro - Fading Strum]
mmmm aaaa
Echoes linger, fading slow
In the heart, they softly glow
