lyrics = [intro - Soft Chime]

[verse – Mountain Tales]
In valleys deep, where echoes rest  
Soft whispers of the past, caress  
oooo aaa iii  

[Pre-Chorus – Echoing Peaks]  
Nature sings, with quiet grace  
In every shadow, a hidden trace  
iiii ooo  

[Chorus – Aurea's Call]  
Dance in light, where spirits play  
Tradition's heart, will never sway  
aaaaa eeee  

[Bridge - Cultural Tides]  
Madal beats, in rhythm's glow  
Harmonies blend, like rivers flow  
shhhhhh

[outro - Fading Echoes]
Whispers fade, yet linger near  
In every heart, the song is clear  
oooo eeee ahhhh]
