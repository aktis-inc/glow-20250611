lyrics = [intro - soft glow]
(softly) In the silence, a name resounds  
(softly) Echoes of grace, lifting the soul  
oooo  
iiiiiiii  
[verse 1 - Rising Light]  
Through the shadows, hope emerges  
In every heartbeat, a promise unfolds  
Whispered truths, in the stillness  
A name that holds the dawn  
zzzzzzhhhhhh  
[Pre-Chorus - Ascend]  
[soft glow]  
oooooo  
In the light that breaks the dark  
Every step a leap of faith  
[Chorus - Eternal Embrace]  
woooooo  
iiiiiii  
In the name, we find our solace  
Boundless love, our hearts ignite  
[Bridge - Celestial Harmony]  
Together we rise, in unity  
Each note a thread of destiny  
Ahhh shhhhhh  
[echoed breath]  
[verse 2 - New Horizons]  
With every whisper, the stars align  
The journey calls, beyond the veil  
A melody of endless grace  
[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  
[distorted whisper] faith… light… eternal… (oo-yeah!)  
[outro - Yalun Reverie]
