[verse 1 – Whispering Strings]
Gentle tides of memory  
Past and present entwine  
In echoes of Ivara's call

[Pre-Chorus – Cultural Pulse]
oooooo  
Harmony transcends time  
In melodies of the heart

[Chorus – Embrace of Echoes]
wooooooo  
iiiiiii  
Voices rising, spirits soar  
In Ivara's vibrant lore

[Bridge - Timeless Dance]
Traditions weave with modern grace  
A dance through time and space  
ahhhhhh

[verse 2 – Rhythmic Flow]
With every beat, stories unfold  
In rhythms, the world is retold

[outro - fading whispers]
ooooo  
iiiiii  
Echoes linger, softly fade  
In Ivara's gentle serenade
