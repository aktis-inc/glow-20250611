lyrics = [intro – Neon Dawn]
ooooo  

[verse 1 – Rhythmic Stride]
Colors paint the sky, beneath the city lights
Tradition whispers, through the night  
aaaaa iiiiiiii

[Pre-Chorus – Cultural Pulse]
Feel the beat, a timeless dance
Modern echoes, in a trance

[Chorus – Dalia's Groove]
Dance and sway, in a timeless bloom  
ooooo aaaaaaa

[Bridge – Electric Heritage]
Flutes sing, tablas speak
A future bright, past to seek  
wooooo iiiiii

[verse 2 – Fusion Flow]
Steps of old, new tales told
Echos blend, in streets of gold  
shhhhhh ooooo

[Outro – Vibrant Fade]
Dance, until the dawn breaks anew  
zzzzzz mmmmm]
