[verse - tranquility]
Whispers through the grass  
Moments held in time  
iiiiiiiiiiiiii  
oooooo  

[chorus - trumpet echo]
Serene silence fills  
Every space and breath  
aaaaaaa  
eeeeee

Inara's call lingers on  
As shadows stretch and fade  
shhhhhhh  

[outro - fading light]
Embrace the quiet night  
With echoes of the day  
zzzzzzzzzz
