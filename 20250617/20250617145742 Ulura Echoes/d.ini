[verse]
Whispers in the wind, tales untold  
Echoes of hearts old and bold  
Silent dreams in moonlit skies

[chorus]
ooooo  
iiiiiii  
Past and present intertwine,  
In Ulura's gentle rhyme  

[bridge - serene flow]
Flow of time, endless stream  
Lost in Ulura's dream  

[outro - echo fade]
sssshhh ooooo  
Memories, soft as night
