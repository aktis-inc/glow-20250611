lyrics = [intro - ethereal strings]

[verse - male lead]
In shadows where dreams dwell
Hearts whisper tales untold

[female response]
In moonlit reveries, we wander
Bound by echoes of old

[chorus - duet]
oooooo
iiiiii

[bridge - instrumental]
[sitar interlude]

[verse - female lead]
Stars guide our silent passage
Through the tapestry of night

[male response]
In the dance of time, we're woven
Eternal in our flight

[outro - gentle fade]
ahhhhhh
ooooooo
