lyrics = [intro - City Awakening]
Whispers in the streets, lights dance

[verse 1 - Connection]  
We are stardust in the glow  
Echoes of a story untold  
Through the night, we find our way  
In the rhythm of the city's sway

[Pre-Chorus - Unity]  
oooooo  
Together we rise and fall  
iiiiiii

[Chorus - Belonging]  
In our hearts, we belong  
In this moment, in this song  
oooo  
ahhhhh

[Bridge - Harmony]  
Voices blend in gentle streams  
Flowing like the city's dreams  
ahhhhhh  
shhhhh

[verse 2 - Journey]  
Every step leads us closer  
To the place where we are free  
Our reflections in the water  
Tell the tales of you and me

[outro - Fade to Light]  
Fiora's song in the night  
wooooo  
iiiiii
