[verse 1]
In whispers of the past, we find our way
Where rivers sing and hearts sway
ooooo iiiiii

[chorus - united voices]
Beneath the sunset's golden glow
Our dreams dance, our love flows
oooooo aaaaa

[bridge - instrumental]
[flute melody]

[verse 2]
Through the hills, our echoes roam
In every breeze, we find our home
iiiiii ooooo

[outro - fade]
Our serenade, forever to stay
In the heart of Lirio, we'll remain
aaaaa iiiiiii]
