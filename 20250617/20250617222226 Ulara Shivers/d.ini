lyrics = [intro]
Gentle guitar strum
Soft city hum  
ooooooo

[verse 1 – Neon Dreams]
Lights flicker as we move
Footsteps echo in the night  
Through the haze, I find a tune  
A melody that feels just right  
aaahhh

[Pre-Chorus – Pulse]
Heartbeat syncs with city beat  
Every corner holds a whisper  
oooooooooo  
iiiiiiiiii

[Chorus – Shiver's Dance]
Woooooo  
Feel the rhythm in our bones  
Every glance a silent song  
Shivers run in electric flows  
Through the night, where we belong  
ooooo

[Bridge – Vibrant Echoes]
Colors swirl in cosmic light  
We’re alive, in the city's embrace  
Ahhhh shhhhhh  
[echoed breath]

[verse 2]
Stories told in fleeting glances  
Paths that cross, chance romances  
Living for the fleeting chances  
Vibrant dreams in neon dances

[outro]
