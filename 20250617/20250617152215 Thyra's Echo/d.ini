[verse 1 – City Dreams]
Dusk falls, whispers in the air
Lights dance, like memories we share
ahhh oooo

[Pre-Chorus – Heartbeats Aligned]
Hands touch, time slows down
Every sound, a familiar song

[Chorus – Echoes of Thyra]
wooooooo  
iiiiiiiii
In your eyes, reflections of us
Every echo, a silent rush

[Bridge - Timeless Whisper]
Through rain, through night
We find our light
ahh shhh  
[soft harmonies]

[verse 2]
Moments fade, but love remains
In the echoes, we find our way

[outro - Fading Light]
oooooo iiiiii
As the city sleeps, our story lingers on
