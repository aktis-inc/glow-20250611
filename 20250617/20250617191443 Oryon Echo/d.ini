Pulsing heartbeats, the river flows
Under neon skies, stories unfold

Tradition and future, hand in hand
Melodies weave a timeless strand

Dance of echoes, vibrant and free
Oryon lights, a symphony

Eternal paths, where cultures blend
In rhythmic steps, journeys mend
ahhhhhhh

In whispers of the past, we find
New horizons in echoes' bind

Fade into the light, a fusion's glow
Where yesterday's dreams help tomorrow grow]
