ooooo

[verse 1]
Melodies whisper through time  
Threads of gold in the night  
Quonda calls, heartstrings play  
Dreams in colors take flight  

[chorus - Reverie Echo]
oooooo
iiiiii
Love’s sweet serenade  
In the echo of the past  
Quonda, sing once more  

[verse 2]
Stories told in the stars  
Every note, a memory  
In the dance of the heart  
Lost in a reverie  

[bridge - Instrumental Nostalgia]
[tabla and flute interlude]
ahhhhh  
ooooo  

[chorus - Reverie Echo]
Quonda, sing once more  
Where the heart finds its tune  
In the echo of the past  
Dreams in colors take flight  

[outro - gentle fade]
ooooo
iiiiiiiii
