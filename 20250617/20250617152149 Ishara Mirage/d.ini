lyrics = [intro - Mirage Whisper]
shhhh ooooooo

[verse 1 - Desert Echoes]
Sand dances with the wind's sigh
Stars above weave tales untold
iiiiiiiiiiiii

[chorus - Oasis Illusion]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiiiii  
In the mirage, dreams align

[bridge - Timeless Journey]  
Oud strings hum through ancient night
Echoes call to distant shores
Ahhh shhhhhh

[verse 2 - Celestial Pathways]
Golden dunes, secrets they hide
Time stands still in moonlit glow
ooooo iiiiii

[outro - Ishara's Call]  
shhhh ooooooo  
Guiding through the night, Ishara leads the way
