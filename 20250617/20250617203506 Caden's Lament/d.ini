[verse 1]
In shadows, secrets unfold  
A love story, bittersweet and cold  
ooooo

[chorus]
Heartbeats echo, in the silent night  
A lover's truth, lost in the fading light  
iiiiiiii

[verse 2]
Promises whispered, now just a trace  
An honest man, left in empty space  
wooooooo

[bridge]
Thunder rolls, as tears fall like rain  
In the city, echoes of his pain  
ahhhhhh

[outro]
Caden's lament, a soulful refrain  
Heartbreak lingers, a lover's disdain
