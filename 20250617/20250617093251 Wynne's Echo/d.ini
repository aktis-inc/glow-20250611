lyrics = [intro - gentle river flow]

[verse - Quiet Harmony]
Soft winds carry tales of old,
In echoes whispered by the stream.
Colors dance in the dawning light,
Where dreams and reality blend.

[chorus - Tranquil Echo]
oooooo
iiiiiiii
Rivers of time, gently unwind,
In the heart's calm embrace.

[bridge - Sitar's Whisper]
Strings sing of ancient paths,
Guided by the stars' silent glow.
oooo aaaa
Whispers of the earth, gentle as a breeze.

[outro - Wynne's Echo]
In the stillness, echoes remain,
A song eternal, whispered and serene.
