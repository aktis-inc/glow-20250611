lyrics = [intro]

[soft verse]
Gentle dreams in a crowded night
Whispers echo through neon light
ooooo iiiii

[chill chorus]
No love lost in the quiet hum
City's song where hearts are numb

[verse 2]
Floating thoughts, a silent tune
Stars align beneath the moon

[soft bridge]
ooooo  
In the echoes, find your way

[outro]
Fade into the night, softly sway]
