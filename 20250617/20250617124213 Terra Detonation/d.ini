lyrics = [intro pulse]

[verse]

City lights flicker, rhythm in the storm  
Underneath the surface, a world reborn  
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Electric Surge]  
[soft crackle]
oooooooooo
In the heart of chaos, echoes collide  
Every beat a battle, in the night

[Chorus – Sonic Blast]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiiiияяяя

[Bridge - Neon Pulse] 
We are the current, flowing through the wire (ignite!)
Our path is lightning, unstoppable fire (alright!)
Ahhh shhhh  
[echoed breath]

[verse 2]
Erase the limits, let them fade  
In the pulse of progress, unafraid  
Beyond the brink, we take our stand

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[distorted whisper] power… surge… detonation… (oo-yeah!)

[outro - Terra Detonation]
