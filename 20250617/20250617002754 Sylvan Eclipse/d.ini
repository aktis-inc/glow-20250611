lyrics = [intro - Whispering Shadows]

[piano & strings build-up]
oooooo

[verse 1 - Moonlit Path]
In the shadow of dreams, we wander
Through echoes of time, hearts ponder
sssshhhh

[Pre-Chorus - Celestial Dance]
iiiiiiiii
Underneath the lunar glow
Our souls in harmony flow

[Chorus - Total Eclipse]
woooo
All fades to night, love ignites
oooooo

[Bridge - Sylvan Call]
In the forest deep, secrets keep
A song of old, whispers unfold
ahhhhhhh

[verse 2 - Echoes of Light]
Through the veil of night, we soar
Bound by fate, forever more
zzzzzz

[outro - Eclipse's Embrace]
oooooo
Hold tight, the night is our guide
iiiiiiii
