lyrics = [intro beat]

[verse 1 – Urban Pulse]
Lights flicker, streets alive
Echoes of stories, where shadows thrive
Feel the rhythm, deep in the night
Arion moves, with silent might
ooooooh

[Chorus – Neon Flow]
In the city glow, we find our way
Beats and bass, guide our sway
Arion vibe, where dreams collide
Underneath the starlit stride
wooooo

[Bridge – Midnight Echo]
Whispers in the alley, secrets unfold
With every step, a story told
Lost in the rhythm, found in the beat
Arion's heart, where the night and city meet
zzz zzz

[verse 2]
Through the maze, we dance and weave
In the pulse of night, we believe
Every corner, a chance to renew
Arion's vibe, ever true

[outro – Fade to Dawn]
As the night fades, we leave our mark
In the city's heart, a lasting spark
ooooo iiiiiiii
