きらめく星空の下で

[verse 1 – Neon Dreams]  
都市の光が踊る  
心は翼を広げて  
あの星まで届くように  
夢の中で響くメロディー

[chorus – Celestial Chorus]  
oooooo  
きらきら、輝く  
心の音が鳴り渡る  
iiiiiii  

[bridge – Whimsical Dance]  
光の中、君と手を取り  
この道を照らす星々  
うふふ、ははは  
心のリズムに乗って

[verse 2]  
街の音が溶け込む  
夜空を見上げ、祈る  
新しい日の始まりを  
一緒に迎えよう

[outro – Harmony Fade]  
ふわりと消える  
星の夢、また会える  
oooooo  
iiiiiii
