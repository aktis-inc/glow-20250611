lyrics = [intro - Soft Awakening]
oooooo

[verse 1]  
The sun drips through the leaves  
Whispering tales of serene dreams  
Gentle echoes in the air  
We breathe in the quiet flair  
oooo  
ahhhh

[Chorus - Nature's Embrace]  
oooooooo  
In the heart's gentle race  
Finding peace in this place

[Bridge - Reflective Echo]  
Voices in the wind,  
A dance of light within  
Shhhhhh

[verse 2]  
Wander through the golden haze  
Every step a gentle phrase  
Nature's song, a lullaby  
In the stillness, we comply  
ahhhh  
wooooo

[outro - Tranquil Fade]  
[soft wind chimes]  
oooooo  
iiiiiiii
