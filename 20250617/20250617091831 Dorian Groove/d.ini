lyrics = [intro - soulful intro]

[verse 1]
In the city lights, we wander
Echoes of the past, whispering
Dorian's groove, a sweet reminder
Of the love in the air, lingering

[chorus]
Oooooo
Guitar strums, hearts align
In this moment, we're divine

[verse 2]
Rhythms of the night surround us
In harmony, we find our way
Dorian whispers, love profound
In this groove, we choose to stay

[bridge]
Ahhhhhh
Through the streets, we glide
With Dorian, side by side

[outro]
Mmmmmmm
City fades, but love remains
In Dorian's groove, we're unchained
