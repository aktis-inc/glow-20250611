[verse]
In the city glow, shadows dance,
Neon dreams in an endless trance,
ooooo

[chorus]
Aether waves carry, our silent cries,
Through the night, where the heart lies,
iiiiiiii

[bridge]
Whispers in the dark, echo through,
Lost in the night, searching for the truth,
ahhhh

[outro - fade]
oooo
Aether's call, in the night... iiiii
