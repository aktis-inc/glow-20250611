[verse]  
Whispers of light, through sacred halls  
In echoes of the past, we rise  

[chorus]  
Oooooo  
iiiiiiii  

[bridge - Divine Light]  
Through the veil, beyond the night  
Our souls unite, in sacred flight  
Ahhhhhhhh  

[outro - Oriel Echoes]  
Soft winds carry, the ancient song  
In the light, we all belong
