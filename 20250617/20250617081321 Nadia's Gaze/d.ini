lyrics = [Sitar Intro - Gentle Fade In]
aaaaa mmmmmm

[Verse 1 - Soft Strings]
Suddenly the room held its breath
A stillness settled just for us
The everyday faded, dissolved

[Pre-Chorus - Flute Weave]
oooooooo
My thoughts scattered like startled birds
Gravity lost its ancient hold

[Chorus - Full Orchestra Swell]
uuuuuuuuuu iiiiiiiiiiii

[Bridge - Reflective]
Was it the light, the angle of the sun?
Or something deeper felt within
A recognition unspoken, vast

[Verse 2 - Build Up]
The colours around me grew brighter
The air felt thin, electrically charged
A simple moment, forever marked

[Chorus - Climactic]
aaaaa ooooooo iiiiii

[Outro - Fade with Strings and Tabla]
mmmmmmmmmm
silence...
[gentle tabla beat fades]
[string harmonics]
