oooooo

[verse - whispers of the garden]
Soft breeze carries tales untold
In the embrace of ancient trees
Mirth dances with morning light
Eternal melodies unfold

[chorus - celestial echoes]
iiiiiiii
Sitar sings to the rising sun
Tabla heartbeats, a timeless rhythm
oooooo

[bridge - spirit's journey]
Flowing river, guide the soul
Through realms of peace and grace
In the silence, we find the whole
Mirthful whispers, a sacred space

[outro - return to stillness]
shhhhhhh
In the garden, all is one
Harmony, a gentle hum
ooooo
