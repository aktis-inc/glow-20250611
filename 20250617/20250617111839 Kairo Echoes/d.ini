City lights flicker, heartbeat syncs  
oooooo aaaa

[verse 1]  
Echoes whisper through the concrete veins  
Night unfolds, dreams in motion  
Confidence swells, under city’s reign  
Kairo calling, no emotion

[Pre-Chorus]   
Urban pulse, relentless beat  
oooooo  
Streets alive, stories untold

[Chorus]   
wooooo  
Kairo echoes, rhythm flows

Through the night, shadows dance  
Unseen paths, endless chance  
ahhhhhh shhhhh

[outro]  
Reflecting lights, fading slow  
City's heartbeat, we let go  
oooooo iiiiiii]
