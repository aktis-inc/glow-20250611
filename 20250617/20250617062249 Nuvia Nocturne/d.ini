lyrics = [intro - gentle rain]

[verse - Twilight Whispers]
Soft echoes of a distant dream
In twilight's gentle hold, we float
ooooooo iiiiiiii

[Chorus - City Lullaby]
Neon lights hum a soothing tune
In the night's embrace, we find calm
wooooooo aaaaaaa

[Bridge - Serene Reflections]
The city's heart beats slow, we breathe
In the quiet dance of shadows, we lose ourselves
shhhhhhh ooooooo

[outro - Fading Echoes]
As night fades, whispers linger
In the dawn's first light, dreams dissolve
zzzzzzzz hhhhhhhh
