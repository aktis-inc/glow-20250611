lyrics = [intro - Echoed Fusion]

[verse 1 - Rhythmic Pulse]
In the city where echoes dance
Traditions blend, a vibrant trance
ooooo aaaaa

[Chorus - Cultural Beat]
Neon lights, the rhythm's call
Modern beats, where memories fall
iiiiiiiiiiii

[Bridge - Ancient Whisper]
Whispers from the past, so near
Instruments of old, we hear
ssshhhhh

[verse 2 - Modern Melody]
Strings and synths, a blend so bright
In the heart of the night, a cultural flight
zzzzzzhhhhh

[outro - Fusion Fade]
Tradition and modernity, hand in hand
A journey through a culturally rich land
