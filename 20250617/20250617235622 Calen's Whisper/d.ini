lyrics = [intro - Soft Wind]

[verse 1 – Floating Dreams]
Gentle stars whisper on the breeze
Heartbeats echo through the twilight
mmmmmmmmmm
oooooo

[Chorus – Calen's Call]
ooooo
In the silence, you will hear
Voices guiding, ever near
iiiii

[Bridge - Twilight Glow]
Lanterns light the path we know
In the warmth, our spirits grow
ahhhhhhh

[verse 2 – Whispered Promises]
Through the night, we find our way
In the calm, we softly sway
ssshhhh

[outro - Fading Light]
oooooo
Dreams unfold in whispered tones
Guiding us to places known
