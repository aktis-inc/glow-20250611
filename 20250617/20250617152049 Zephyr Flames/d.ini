woooooo

[verse 1 – Ember's Call]
In the night, the fire rises (oooo)
Whispered dreams ignite the skies (ahhh)
Through the storm, we find our way
Burning bright, no shadows stay

[Pre-Chorus – Flame Surge]
Feel the heat, the world ignites (oooo)
Every heartbeat, a new fight (ahhh)

[Chorus – Inferno Dance]
wooooo
iiiiii
Dance with flames, in the light
Our spirits soar, beyond the night

[Bridge - Blaze's Path]
We are the fire, we are the storm
In our hearts, a world is born (oooo)
Ashes to life, we are reborn (ahhh)
Feel the power, in every form

[outro - Zephyr Flames]
shhhhhhh oooo
In the end, we'll rise again
In the flames, we find our zen
