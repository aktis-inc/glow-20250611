[verse]

Hand in hand we dance
On the colorful path
Heartbeats echo in time
oooooo

[chorus - Vibrant Pulse]  
Joy fills the air
Voices rise, intertwine
Nimble steps, we are free
iiiiiiiiiiii

[bridge - Cultural Flow]  
Tradition whispers
In the echoes of the past
New stories unfold

[outro - Festival Fade]  
Laughter and song
As the night embraces day
