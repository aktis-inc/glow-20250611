(Street sounds)  
ooooo

[verse 1 - Palis Stroll]  
Rhythms dance through the air  
Voices echo, vibrant flare  
In the city, we find our beat  
Every step feels so sweet

[Pre-Chorus - Urban Groove]  
ooooo  
Every heartbeat, every move  
Together we find the groove

[Chorus - Neon Vibes]  
oooooo  
iiiiii  
Dance with me, under the lights  
Palis vibes, reach new heights

[Bridge - City Echo]  
In the midst of the crowd, we shine  
Neon dreams, intertwined  
oooooo  
shhhhhh

[verse 2]  
Lost in rhythm, found our way  
In this moment, we sway  
Vibrations guide our soul  
Palis makes us whole

[outro - Fade to Streets]  
(echoing footsteps)  
ooooo
