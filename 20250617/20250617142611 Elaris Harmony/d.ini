lyrics = [intro - Gentle Waves]
wooo aaaa
Soft whispers in the breeze

[verse 1 â€“ Sunset Glow]
Golden light kisses the shore
Every note a heart's encore
Elaris sings in harmony
In the calm, we find our key

[Chorus â€“ Embrace]
ooooo iiiiii
Hearts align, in tender time
Underneath the fading sky

[bridge - Serene Reflection]
Silent echoes, gentle ties
In this moment, love resides
ahhh

[outro - Harmony's End]
Soft chords fade into the night
Elaris whispers, all is right
oooo aaaa
