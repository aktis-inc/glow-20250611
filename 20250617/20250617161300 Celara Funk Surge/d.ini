[smooth intro groove]  
woooo  

[verse 1 – Bassline Strut]  
Neon streets alive with sound  
Brass and beats, rhythm bound  
Guitar strums, lively vibe  

[chorus – Funk Surge]  
ooooooo  
Bass drops, hearts align  
Funk groove, city shine  

[bridge – Celara Flow]  
Step by step, move and glide  
Funky waves, we won't hide  

[verse 2]  
Lights flicker, music soars  
Funky echoes through the doors  

[outro – Groove Fade]  
Playful echoes, urban beat  
Celara's funk, can't be beat  
oooooo
