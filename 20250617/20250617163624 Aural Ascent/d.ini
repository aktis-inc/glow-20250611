[verse 1 – City Pulse]
In the neon glow, shadows dance  
Echoes of dreams, lost in trance  
woooooo  
iiiii

[Pre-Chorus – Skyscape]
High above, the city breathes  
Each heartbeat, a story weaves  

[Chorus – Hero's Call]
Flyyyyyy  
Aural ascent, reaching high  
Through the night, the stars align  
oooooo  

[Bridge - Reflection]
Saved a world, but lost the light  
In your eyes, a silent night  
ahhhhh

[verse 2]
Towers rise, but hearts still yearn  
Lessons learned, bridges burn  
zzzzzzzz

[glitch build-up]  
oooooo

[outro - City Fade]
Through the mist, echoes fall  
City lights, answer the call]
