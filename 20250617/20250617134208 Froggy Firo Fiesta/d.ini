lyrics = [intro - Fiesta Call]
(Accordion riff)  
woooooo

[verse 1 – Streets Alive]  
Clarinet calls in the night,  
Feet tapping, the rhythm's bright.  
Colors swirl in the air,  
Firo leads, a dance so fair.  
oooooo

[Chorus – Froggy Leap]  
oooooo  
Hop, skip, join the beat,  
Energy flows, can't retreat.  
Firo's tune, a joyful meet,  
Froggy's leap, we repeat.  
wooooooo

[Bridge - Neon Glide]  
Accordion sings, violin cries,  
Under neon, the spirit flies.  
Froggy's world, a surprise,  
Dance the night, no goodbyes.  
ahhhhhh

[verse 2 – Celebration's Wave]  
Harmonies weave, stories told,  
Tradition's heart, visions bold.  
Firo's joy, a sight to hold,  
In this fiesta, warmth unfolds.  
oooooo

[outro - Festive Glow]  
(Clarinet echoes)  
ooooo
Dance away, feel the glow,  
Froggy Firo, time to go.
