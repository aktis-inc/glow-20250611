[verse 1 - Lost Echoes]  
In the digital haze, echoes call  
Can't let go, but I fall  
Hold me close, through the night  
Silent cries, fade to light  
oooooo  
aaahhh

[Chorus - Aeris Embrace]  
iiiiii  
Don't leave, stay here  
In this moment, disappear  
iiiiii  
Echoes whisper, love's refrain

[Bridge - Mist and Light]  
Aaaaah  
Through the mist, find the way  
Lost in echoes, here I stay  
Wooooo  
iiiiii

[outro - Fading Echoes]  
shhhhh  
oooo  
Lost, but found, in Aeris sound
