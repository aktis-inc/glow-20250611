oooo
iiiiiiii

[verse 1 - Evening Whisper]
In the glow of dusk, stories breathe
Through fields of gold, whispers weave
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus - Harmonious Echo]  
[soft chime]
oooooooooo
Between the heartbeats, echoes play
Melodies dancing in twilight's sway

[Chorus - Kalum Serenade]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Cultural Embrace] 
Traditions held, in rhythm's flow
In unity, our spirits grow
Ahhhh shshsh

[verse 2]
Through the valleys, songs arise
In harmony, the night complies

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[echoed harmony] peace… tradition… unity… (oo-yeah!)

[outro - Kalum Serenade]
