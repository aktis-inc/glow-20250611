lyrics = [intro soft]
(whispered) The dawn is here, light in the air
oooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiii

[verse 1 – New Beginnings]
In the gentle light, we find the day
Every smile, a new story
Hold the moment, let it play
We gather 'round, in harmony

[Pre-Chorus – Joyful Echoes]  
ooooooo
Together we sing, hearts in tune
A melody of dreams, bright as the moon

[Chorus – Lumira's Light]  
woooooooo  
iiiiiii

[Bridge – Celebration Glow] 
Balloons and laughter, in the sky (rise high!)
A symphony of love, we fly (oh my!)
Ahhhhhh shhhhhh  

[verse 2]
Every heartbeat, a celebration
In the glow of this creation
With every breath, a new sensation

[soft chorus]
oooo

[outro - First Light]
