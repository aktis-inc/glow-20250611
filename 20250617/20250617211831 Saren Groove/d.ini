lyrics = [intro - Neon Pulse]
ooooooo  
(Soft vocals) The night ignites, stars align  
ooooooo  

[verse 1 – Time Warp]  
Shadows dance under neon skies  
Every heartbeat, an echo from the past  
Fingers snap, feet tap, we move as one  
ooooo  

[Chorus – Saren Groove]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii  
Feel the rhythm, let it take you high  
Step by step, we reach the sky  
ahhhh  

[Bridge - Echoes of Yesterday]  
Disco lights, memories ignite  
Falling stars, a timeless flight  
ahhhh  

[verse 2]  
Colors swirl, the night is young  
A melody of dreams unsung  
Together here, where we belong  
ooooo  

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[distorted whisper] rhythm… groove… endless… (oo-yeah!)

[outro - Saren Groove]  
oooo ahhhh  
iiiiiiiii
