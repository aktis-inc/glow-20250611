[verse 1]
Soft whispers in the twilight haze  
Beneath the stars, our hearts align  
ooooo iiiii

[chorus]
Echoes of dreams in every gaze  
Love's gentle rhythm, a timeless sign  
ooooo aaaaa

[bridge - ethereal flow]
In the quiet, where shadows dance  
Our souls entwined, by chance  
ooooo iiiii

[outro - fading light]
As night embraces the dawn's advance  
A melody of love, a celestial trance  
ooooo iiiii aaaahhh]
