[verse]

Mechanical heartbeats sync with time  
Redstone pulses, echoes chime  
iiiiii ooooo  

[glitch build-up]

[Pre-Chorus - Circuit Flow]
oooo  
Digital veins, electric glow  
Pathways open, currents flow  

[Chorus - Redstone Rhythm]
wooooo  
iiiiiiiiii  
Patterns shift, light ignites  
Through the maze, endless nights  

[Bridge - Binary Drift]
Code whispers, secrets untold  
In the wires, stories unfold  
ahhhhhhh shhhhhhhh  

[outro - Quor's Echo]
