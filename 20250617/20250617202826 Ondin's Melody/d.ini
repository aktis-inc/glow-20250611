[verse 1]
In the whisper of leaves, echoes of time
Memories linger, soft as a rhyme

[Pre-Chorus – Heart's Embrace]
ooooooo  
Gentle whispers, calling me home

[Chorus – Ondin's Touch]
iiiiiiii  
Warmth in the breeze, solace in the night

[Bridge – Twilight's Glow]
In the fading light, dreams take flight
ooooo ahhhh

[outro - Melody's End]
Softly we drift, into the night
