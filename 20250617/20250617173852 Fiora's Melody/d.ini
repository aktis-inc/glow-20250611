lyrics = [intro rhythm]
(Traditional flute) ahhh ahhhhh  
(Vocal chant) ooooo iiiii

[verse 1 – Lively Streets]
Through the alleyways, echoes of past
Steps dance on cobblestones
Laughter rings, stories untold

[Chorus – Cultural Pulse]
oooooo  
iiiiiii
Vibrant hearts, beating as one
Melodies weave, threads of time

[Bridge - Fusion Dance]
Tradition meets modern flair
Colors blend, soar through the air
ooooo ahhhh

[verse 2]
Feet move, earth's embrace
Journey shared, moments traced
Harmony in every glance

[outro - Fiora's Melody]
whispered tales… shared dreams… endless rhythm…
