lyrics = [intro - gentle dawn]

[verse 1 - Awakening]  
Saanware... ooooo  
iiiiiiiiii  
Melody whispers through the breeze  
Harmony dances on the leaves  

[pre-chorus - Echoes]  
(soft tabla)  
In every note, a story unfolds  
Ancient rhythms, tales retold  
iiiiiiiiii

[chorus - Sargam Queen]  
Orenda...  
Sound and soul unite  
Eternal night  
ahhhhhh iiiiiii

[bridge - Serene Flow]  
Sitar speaks, in gentle waves  
Echoing through time's embrace  
zzzzzzhhhhh

[verse 2 - Resonance]  
Voices blend, like rivers meet  
A tapestry of sound, complete  
Ahhh... ooooo

[outro - Harmony's Flight]  
Floating on a timeless stream  
In the quiet, we dream  
iiiiiiiiiiiiii]
