lyrics = [intro - gentle rise]
ooooo

[verse 1 - Reflection]
Clouds drift slowly, time unwinds  
In water’s gaze, secrets hide  
iiiiii

[chorus - Embrace]
wooooo  
Gentle waves, hold my dreams  
Beneath the surface, whispers gleam  

[bridge - Tranquil Flow]
Flowing softly, paths unknown  
Every ripple, a gentle tone  
ahhhhh

[verse 2 - Still Waters]
Silence speaks in subtle hues  
A mirror of skies, endless blues  

[outro - Fade to Blue]
oooooo  
iiiiii  
Soft echoes, fading light
