[verse 1 - City Lights]
Underneath the urban glow
Whispers of stories untold
Hearts beat with a tender ache
In shadows, memories awake
ooooo

[Chorus - Echoes of Love]
Wandering through the night
Holding dreams tight
ooooo
iiiiiiiii
Love's melody in the air

[bridge - Timeless Serenade]
Strumming strings of fate
ooooo
iiiiiiiii
Underneath the starlit sky

[verse 2 - Fading Echoes]
Moments drift like falling rain
In the night, we feel the same
Chasing shadows, chasing dreams
In the silence, love redeems

[outro - Distant Memory]
ooooo
iiiiiiiii
Echoes linger, fade away
