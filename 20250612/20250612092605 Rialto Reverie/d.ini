lyrics = [intro]
ooooo

[verse 1]
In the dance of dreams, echoes of the past
Colors weave tales, timeless and vast
Rialto calls, with whispers so bold

[bridge - Rhythmic Flow]
Tabla beats, like heartbeats align
Sitar sings, weaving through time
iiiiii aaaaaa

[chorus]
Eternal reverie, beneath the sky
Where every note is a lullaby
oooooo

[instrumental interlude]

[verse 2]
Through the arches of sound, we glide
In a tapestry where worlds collide
Resonance of souls, in harmony

[glitch build-up]
shhhhhh oooo

[outro]
Reverie's embrace, never letting go
A symphony of life, in endless flow
