lyrics = [intro - ocean whispers]

[verse 1 - Tidal Call]
Feel the rhythm, let it flow
Oceans dance, we move slow
Tropical winds, they guide us
Through the nights, we ride thus

[Pre-Chorus - Wave Rise]
ooooo iiiiii
Catch the vibe, let it spin
Under stars, let it begin

[Chorus - Max Groove]
Dance to the sound of the sea
Feel the pulse, wild and free
oooooo iiiiii
Shake it, break it, let it be

[Bridge - Sunset Glow]
Colors burst in the sky
Rhythms lift, spirits fly
Ahhhh aaaaa
We're alive, never shy

[verse 2 - Ocean's Edge]
Tide rolls in with the sound
Energy in waves surround
We unite, move in sync
Feel the pulse, feel the link

[outro - Tidal Vibe]
Let the night take control
Lose yourself, make it whole
iiiiii oooooo
