[verse 1 - Electric Pulse]
In the city glow, with shadows we roam  
Neon lights guide, where the heartbeat's our home  
ooooo iiiii

[Chorus - Charisma Beat]  
Feel the rhythm, let it take control  
Charisma lights up the night, makes us whole  
wooooo oooo

[bridge - Urban Echo]  
Under the city skies, dreams intertwine  
Every step we take, it's a sign  
shhhh zzzzz

[verse 2 - Rhythm Flow]
The streets alive, with tales of the bold  
Stories untold, in the night unfold  
eeeee uuuuu

[Chorus - Charisma Beat]  
Feel the rhythm, let it take control  
Charisma lights up the night, makes us whole  
wooooo oooo

[outro - Fade to Night]
Neon dreams, where the echoes reside  
In the city’s heart, with the night, we glide  
zzzzhhhhh iiiii
