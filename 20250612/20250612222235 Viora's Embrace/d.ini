lyrics = [intro – Whispered Echoes]
ahhh ooooo

[verse 1 – Twilight Longing]  
In the shadows of the night  
Our hearts find their way  
Silent whispers call us home  
Love's gentle sway  
iiiiiii

[chorus – Embrace]  
ooooo  
Feel the warmth, the gentle fire  
In your eyes, I find desire  
ahhhh  

[bridge – Soul's Dance]  
Together we dance, in silent grace  
Time stands still, in this place  
zzzzzz

[verse 2 – Heart's Symphony]  
Every note, a story told  
In your arms, I unfold  
Melodies weave our fate  
Love's eternal embrace  
ooooo

[outro – Fading Light]  
ahhh ooooo  
Let the night carry our dreams  
In the silence, love redeems  
iiiiiii
