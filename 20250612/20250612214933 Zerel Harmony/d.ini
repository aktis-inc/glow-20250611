[verse]

Guitar strings hum, hearts align
In the rhythm of the sun
Echoes of joy, dance divine
Together we are one
oooo aaa

[Pre-Chorus – Sunset Glow]  
Let the melody flow
Feel the warmth and the glow

[Chorus – Harmony Wave]  
We dance till the dawn
With Zerel, we belong
ooooooo  
iiiiii

[Bridge - Joy Unfold] 
Laughter in the breeze, dreams arise
Colors blend in the skies
ahhhh shhhh

[verse 2]
Every step a celebration
In this vibrant creation
Life's a song, we sing along

[outro - Zerel Harmony]
