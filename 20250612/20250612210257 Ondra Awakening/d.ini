lyrics = [intro - Resonant Pulse]

[verse 1 – Urban Pulse]
Through the veins of the city, I rise  
Past the shadows where the echoes lie  
Concrete jungle, where whispers collide  
I'm the dawn breaking through the night  
rrrrrrrrr  

[Pre-Chorus – Tension Build]
oooo  
Feel the rumble beneath your feet  
Every heartbeat, a defiant beat  

[Chorus – Rise and Roar]
woooooo  
iiiiiiiiii  
Unleash the roar, let the spirit soar  
Ondra's awakening, forevermore  

[Bridge - Steel and Soul]
In the clash of steel, find my soul  
A symphony of chaos taking control  
ahhhhhh  

[outro - Fading Echo]
Echoes fade, but the fire stays  
Ondra's journey, reshaping the days  
shhhhhh
