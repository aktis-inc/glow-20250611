lyrics = [intro dream]

[verse 1]
whispers dance along the stream  
carry me, oh gentle breeze  
ooooooo

[chorus – Flowing Echo]
i feel the pull, i drift away  
lyria's flow, a sweet ballet  
iiiiiiiiii

[bridge – Ethereal Drift]
lost in waves, the world asleep  
silent echoes, secrets keep  
ahhhhhh

[verse 2]
stars align, guide my way  
in this dream, i wish to stay  
oooooo

[outro – Fading Tide]
gentle tides, take me home  
in the flow, i'll never roam  
woooooo
