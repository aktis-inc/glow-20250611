The city hums with ancient tales  
Lights dance in rhythmic steps

Tradition's beat, a living sound  
In the heart of modern ground

Heartbeat of the past, future's embrace  
Echoes through the urban space

Melodies weave through time's thread  
Stories told, never dead  
oooo ahhhh

[outro - Fade to Tradition]  
oooo  
iiiiii
