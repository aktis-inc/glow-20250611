[verse 1 – Moonlit Groove]  
Dancing under the silver glow  
Where melodies of the night flow  
Steps in sync with the heart's beat  
Ravyn's sky, where dreams meet  
la la la

[Pre-Chorus – Night Whisper]  
ooooo  
In the city's embrace  
We find our place

[Chorus – Celestial Celebration]  
wooooo  
Under the moon's gentle light  
We dance till the morning bright  
oooooo

[Bridge – Starlight Serenade]  
Echoes of joy in every glance  
This is our moonlight dance  
shhhhhh

[verse 2 – Rhythm of the Stars]  
Guitar strums weave the air  
Piano keys, a night affair  
Laughter blends with the breeze  
In this moment, we are free

[outro – Ravyn's Embrace]  
ooooo  
Dance till the stars fade away  
In Ravyn's embrace, we sway  
oooooo
