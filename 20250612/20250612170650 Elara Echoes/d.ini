[verse 1 - Echoes Begin]
Drums call, earth replies
Voices rise, under skies
ooooo aaaaaa

[Chorus - Vibrant Pulse]
Energy flows, through the night
Dancing feet, hearts ignite
iiiiiiiii eeee

[Bridge - Harmonic Dance]
Guitar sings, stories told
Rhythms weave, tales unfold
ahhhh ooooo

[verse 2 - Rhythmic Journey]
Paths we tread, in harmony
Beats align, set us free
ooooo iiiaaa

[outro - Elara Echoes]
Echoes fade, yet remain
In our hearts, the refrain
eeeeee ooo]
