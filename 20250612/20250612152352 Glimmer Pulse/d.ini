lyrics = [intro beat]

[verse 1]
In the city's core, neon dreams,
Lights flicker, urban schemes,
ooooo  
iiiiii

[Pre-Chorus]
Pulsing beats, shadows play,
In the night, we find our way

[Chorus]
Glimmering through the haze
Dance with fire, in this blaze

[Bridge - Echo]
City whispers, lost in time
Rhythms blend, in perfect rhyme

[verse 2]
Voices rise, echoes call
In the night, we stand tall

[glitch build-up]
ooooo iiiiii

[outro - Fade]
Pulse of the city, endless night
In the glimmer, we ignite]
