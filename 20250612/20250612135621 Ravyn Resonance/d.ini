wooooo  
iiiiii 

[verse 1 - Dream Whisper]  
Heart in echoes, silent beat  
World fades, dreams entwine  
In this moment, all aligns  
oooooo

[Pre-Chorus - Rising Pulse]  
soft whispers flow  
In the night, emotions glow  
iiiiiiiiii

[Chorus - Ravyn's Call]  
wooooo  
Heartbeats collide, worlds apart  
In this space, love imparts  
ooooooo

[Bridge - Ethereal Drift]  
Floating high, in vibrant streams  
Lost in time, vibrant dreams  
shhhhhh  
aaaaaaa

[verse 2 - Soul's Echo]  
In the silence, find the truth  
Dreams unfold, love's sweet proof  
iiiiiiiiii

[outro - Resonance Fade]  
oooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiii  
Emotions linger, echoes stay  
In the heart, forever play
