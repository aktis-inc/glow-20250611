lyrics = [intro - Dreamy Prelude]

[verse 1 - Whispering Winds]  
Soft echoes in the night  
Carry whispers of the heart  
Through the gentle breeze  
A story starts  

[Pre-Chorus - Enchanted Veil]  
Floating softly, dreams unfold  
In the silence, secrets told  
oooooo aaaahhh  

[Chorus - Heart's Embrace]  
iiiiiii  
Feel the warmth, the gentle light  
In the shadows, love ignites  

[Bridge - Mystic River]  
Flowing with the current's grace  
Time and space, we embrace  
oooo eeee  

[outro - Fading Echoes]  
As the echoes fade away  
In the silence, we will stay  
oooooo iiiiiii
