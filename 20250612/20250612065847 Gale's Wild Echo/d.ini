wooooooo
ooooooo

[verse 1 - Gale's Whisper]
In the storm's embrace, we dance
Echoes of the night, wild chance
Feel the pulse, the rhythm's call
We rise, we fall, we give it all
aaaaa iiiiii

[Pre-Chorus - Energy Surge]
ooooooo
Hear the beat, feel the rush
In the wild, we trust

[Chorus - Wild Echo]
ooohhhhhh
Gale's wild echo, let it flow
Vibrate through the night, let it show

[Bridge - Rhythm Ride]
We ride the wind, we chase the light
In the echoes, we find our flight
hhhhh shhhhh

[verse 2 - Pulse Drive]
Across the night, the rhythm waves
In every beat, a world it saves
Hold tight, the moment's here
In the echo, we disappear
zzzzzzzz

[outro - Echo Fade]
woooooo
ooooooo
