[verse 1 – Whispering Winds]  
Gentle breeze, whispers call  
In sapphire light, shadows fall  
ooooohhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Rhythm Pulse]  
Heartbeats blend, cultures meet  
Echoing dreams, beneath our feet  
ooooo iiiiiiii  
[Chorus – Sapphire Dance]  
Hold my hand, let’s whirl away  
In the sapphire's sway, we will stay

Strings and beats, a worldly flight  
In this moment, day turns night  
ahhhh iiiii

Glimmers in the night sky  
Voices soar, spirits high  
ooooo

[outro - Whirl of Sapphire]  
Together we sing  
In the sapphire's ring  
wooo iiiiiiiii]
