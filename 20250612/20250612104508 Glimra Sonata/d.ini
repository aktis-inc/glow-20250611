soft iiiii aaaaa

[verse 1 – Traditional Pulse]  
Melodies dance in twilight  
In rhythm, hearts align  
Currents of time flow gently  
Through the sound, we find

[Chorus – Glimra's Echo]  
oooooo  
iiiiiii  
Harmony in motion  
Eternal waves of sound  
  
[Bridge - Cultural Fusion]  
Ancient whispers, modern beats  
Through the city, life repeats  
ahhhh eeehhh  
[echoed resonance]

[verse 2]  
Threads of past weave through now  
In this moment, we vow  
To carry forward the song  
Together, we belong

[outro - Sonata's End]  
shhhhh iiiii  
gentle fade to silence]
