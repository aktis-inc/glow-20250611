ooooo  

[verse]  
Rhythms collide, we find our beat  
In the neon glow, our spirits meet  
Liruna whispers, echoes in time  
Bassline drops, electric chime  
iiiiii  

[chorus - Luminous Dance]  
oooooo  
Move with the light, hearts ignite  

[bridge - Digital Flow]  
Synth waves rise, tides of sound  
In this city, we're unbound  
shhhh  

[drop - Pulse Surge]  
wooooo  

[outro - Fade into Neon]  
ooooo  
Light fades, but the pulse remains
