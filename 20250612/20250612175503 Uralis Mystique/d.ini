lyrics = [intro]
Mystic winds aaaa

[verse 1]  
Whispers of time, a tale unfolds  
In the shadows, secrets told ooooo  
Echos of the past, in the present glow

[Chorus - Uralis Aura]  
iiiiiiii  
Dancing light, dreams take flight  
Embrace the night, under the sky  
wooooooo

[bridge]  
Through the veils, a path is found  
Harmony in every sound  
A journey within, where we align

[verse 2]  
Gentle streams, soothing dreams  
In the heart of silence, echoes gleam  
Moments suspended, in the Uralis beam

[outro - Fade to Mystique]  
oooo aaaaa  
iii ooo iii
