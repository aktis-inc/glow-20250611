lyrics = [intro - Electric Surge]

[verse 1 - Dive Deep]
Broken echoes, chasing dreams  
Inside the chaos, no retreat  
ooooooo  
iiiiiii  

[Pre-Chorus - Rising Tide]  
Rushing waves, under the skin  
Feel the pull, the dive begins  

[Chorus - Xylo Dive]  
oooooo  
Dive into the night, we run  
iiiiiiii  

[Bridge - Under Currents]  
Lost in the flow, we drift away  
oooo yeah  
Rebel hearts in the undertow  

[verse 2 - Electric Vibe]  
Sparks fly high, in the static  
Life's a race, no time to panic  

[glitch build-up]  
shhhhhhhh  

[outro - Final Dive]  
Xylo calling, feel the rush  
In this dive, we trust  
ooooo  
iiiiiii
