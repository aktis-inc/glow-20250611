lyrics = [intro - gentle piano]
(Soulful voice) Amazing grace, light shines through
(Soulful voice) In every heart, a melody anew
oooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiiiii

[verse 1 – Grace Walk]
Flowing like the morning sun (shine bright)
Every step we take, we're one (uniting)
Voices rise and spirits lift
We're walking in the light of grace

[Pre-Chorus – Soulful Rise]  
[soft choir hum]
oooooo
In the stillness, find the call
Every moment, grace for all

[Chorus – Harmony Burst]  
wooooooo  
Grace flows, iiiii

[Bridge - Spirit's Embrace] 
Embrace the warmth, feel the light (within)
Every soul, a beacon bright (shine)
Ahhhh mmmmmm  
[echoed harmony]

[verse 2]
Journey on, with hearts aglow
In the light, where blessings flow
Every breath, a song of grace

[glitch build-up]  
oooooo mmmmm  

[gentle whisper] grace... hope... light...

[outro - Jovia Grace]
