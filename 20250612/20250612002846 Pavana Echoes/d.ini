[verse]
Distant echoes call  
Through time and tradition  
Rhythms of the past  
Weaving tales untold  

[chorus]
ooooo  
Pavana, dance of echoes  
Resonance in every step  
iiiiii  

[bridge]
Whispers in the wind  
Heartbeats in harmony  
oooooo

[outro - Echoes Fade]  
Rhythms linger, softly fade  
Pavana's timeless serenade
