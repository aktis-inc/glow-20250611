lyrics = [intro]
(gentle guitar strum)
whispering breeze, echoes in time
hmmmmmm  
ooooooo

[verse 1]
Across the twilight, your gaze lingers
In the city's glow, dreams intertwine
heartbeats echo, like a distant chime

[Pre-Chorus]
softly calling, in the night air
memories dance, in the moonlight's care
wooo oooo

[Chorus]
Ravyn's gaze, a tender embrace
ooooo
beneath the stars, our secret place

[Bridge]
in the calm of night, hearts align
gentle whispers, across space and time
ahhhh

[outro]
twilight fades, dreams remain
hmmmm
Ravyn's gaze, forever in frame
