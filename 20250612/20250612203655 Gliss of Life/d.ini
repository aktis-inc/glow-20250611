lyrics = [intro - Gentle Echo]
lalala  
ooooooo

[verse 1 – Timeless Whispers]  
In echoes of time, we drift  
Moments linger, soft and swift  
iiiiiiii

[chorus – Gliss of Heart]  
No regrets, just the dance of fate  
With each note, the heart elates  
oooooo aaaaa

[bridge – Nostalgic Waves]  
Sitar sings, tales of yore  
Tabla beats, forevermore  
shhhhhh

[verse 2 – Melodic Dreams]  
Life's canvas, painted with sound  
In each melody, love is found  
lalalala

[outro – Eternal Embrace]  
Softly fades, the music's grace  
In its warmth, we find our place  
ooooo iiiiii]
