[verse 1]
Echoes of a timeless song  
In every heart, it plays along  
Rhythms dance in vibrant hues

[Chorus]
Raga beats, they call your name  
In the night, a bright flame  
oooooo iiiii

[Bridge]
Tradition meets the modern beat  
Steps align, in joy they meet  
ahhhhhh  

[verse 2]
Strings of sitar weave the tale  
In this dance, we never fail  
Colors burst, in harmony  

[outro - Raga Rhythms]
