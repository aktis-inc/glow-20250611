lyrics = [intro - Desert Echo]

[verse - Ethereal Call]
ahhhh iiiiiiii
ألحان في الليل
تنسج خيوط الحلم

[chill drop]

[Pre-Chorus - Oasis Beat]
woooooo
خطواتنا - رقص بين النجوم
أصوات تنادي - هنا وهناك

[Chorus - Galea Reverie]
هنا في قلب الصحراء
mmmmmm  
iiiiii

[Bridge - Rhythmic Pulse]
صدى الحياة في كل نغمة (وااااو)
الليل يسافر في ضوء القمر (نعم)
sssshhhhh

[verse 2]
تتراقص الأضواء
قصة تروى في كل لحن
موسيقى تجمعنا

[outro - Fading Echo]
