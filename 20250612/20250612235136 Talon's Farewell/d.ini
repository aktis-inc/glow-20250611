lyrics = [intro - Mystical Echoes]
soft whispers
aaaaaa ooooo

[verse 1 - Twilight Path]
In the shadow of the trees
A journey through the leaves
Silent whispers call my name
In the temple, there's no shame
oooooo iiiiiii

[chorus - Farewell Hymn]
Talon's wings embrace the night
In the golden fading light
oooo oooo aaaaa

[bridge - Solitary Echo]
Through the mist, the path unwinds
In the echoes, truth we find
sssssshhh

[verse 2 - Golden Light]
In the twilight, secrets hide
Journey's end, side by side
With the past, we gently part
In the temple, find your heart
oooooo iiiiiii

[outro - Talon's Flight]
Embrace the night, spread your wings
In the shadows, the temple sings
aaaaaaaaa iiiiiiii]
