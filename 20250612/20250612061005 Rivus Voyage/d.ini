[verse - Ocean's Call]
The waves rise high, secrets in the foam
Beneath the sky, the ship finds its home
aahhhhhhhh oooooooo

swoooooosh

In the silence, whispers of the sea
Echo through time, calling destiny
ahhhhhhh shhhhhhh

The sun sets low, painting the sky
The voyage continues, under the stars' eye
ooooo iiiiiii aaaa
