lyrics = [intro - island breeze]
wooooo  
oooooo

[verse 1 ‚Äì Island Pathways]  
Riding on the rhythm rail  
Through the heart of this paradise  
Skank the night, and greet the day  
Feel the pulse, and let it play  
ooooo

[Chorus ‚Äì Ulani Groove]  
wooooo  
Feel it take you away  
On this Zion train  
ooooo

[Bridge - Tropical Echoes]  
Sway with the breeze, in harmony  
Voices sing in unity  
Ahhhh yeeeaaa

[verse 2 ‚Äì Rhythmic Journey]  
Bassline carries through the air  
Syncopated beats everywhere  
Joyful hearts, and feet that move  
In the warmth of this groove  
zzzzzz

[outro - Fade Away]  
oooooo  
wooooooo  
Let the rhythm guide you home  
Ulani's groove, never alone
