[verse 1]
oooommm
Echoes in the temple
Sacred whispers flow
Harmony in the heart

[Pre-Chorus â€“ Devotional Rise]
Chants of old
New rhythms unfold
Jorani calls, spirit ascends

[Chorus â€“ Reverence]
ahhhhhhhh
iiiiiiiiii
Unity of sound and soul

[Bridge - Spiritual Path]
Tabla beats, flute weaves
Steps in the sacred grove
Journey within, find peace

[verse 2]
Sunlight through leaves
Divine moments captured
Jorani guides, spirit soars

[outro - Ethereal Fade]
oooooo
Chants linger, peace remains
