ahhh ooooo

[verse 1 – Harmonious Echo]  
Voices entwined, like whispers in the wind  
Melodies flow, where the heart begins  
oooooooo

[chorus – Serenade Symphony]  
Together we sing, a timeless refrain  
In the echoes of love, we remain  
ahhh ahhh

[bridge – Nostalgic Dance]  
Every note a memory, every chord a dream  
In our duet, the past and present gleam  
oooo woooo

[outro - Sonare Fade]  
iiiiiiiii  
Serenade, serenade, echoes never fade  
ahhhh
