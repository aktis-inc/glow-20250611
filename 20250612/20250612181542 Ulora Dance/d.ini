[verse 1 – Twilight Whispers]
The city calls my name  
In shadows, dreams take flight  
ooooo  
iiiiiiii

[Pre-Chorus – Rising Tides]  
The streets are alive,  
Echoes in the night  
woooooo  
ooooooo

[Chorus – Dance of Light]  
Feel the rhythm of the heart  
Lose yourself in the art  
Dance, dance, dance  
aaaaa

[Bridge - City Dreams]  
Through the alleys and the stars  
We find who we are  
shshshshsh

[verse 2 – Urban Pulse]
Lights flicker, stories unfold  
In the silence, secrets told  
zzzzzzzz

[outro - Ulora Dance]
Twilight fades, the dance remains  
In our hearts, an endless refrain  
oooo iiiii ooooo]
