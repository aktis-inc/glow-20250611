lyrics = [intro rhythm]

[verse 1 – Heartbeat Echoes]
Drums of the earth, beat like a heart
Through the fields, whispers start
oooo ooooo

[Chorus – Dance of Cultures]
iiiiiiiiii
Rhythms flow, tales untold
In the dance, stories unfold

[Bridge - Unity Pulse]
Hands in the air, voices call
Together we rise, never fall
ahhh ooooh

[verse 2 – Modern Journey]
Tradition meets the city lights
Cultures blend, new heights
sssshhhh iiiii

[glitch build-up]
oooooo aaaah

[outro - Ithera Rhythms]
