lyrics = [intro - tabla echo]

[verse 1 - Journey Begins]
Rhythms of the heart, echo in the night
Melodies of the past, take flight
iiiiiiiiii aaaaaa

[Chorus - Drive Pulse]
ooooo woooo
On a road where dreams align
Every note, a journey's sign

[Bridge - Sonata Flow]
In the wind, whispers of time
Colors blend, heartbeats chime
shhhhhh ooooo

[verse 2 - Horizon Glimpse]
Chasing the horizon, where the sun meets the sea
A song of the universe, wild and free
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[outro - Fade to Dawn]
Eternal echoes in the dawn
Sonata journey, never gone
oooooo ahhhhh]
