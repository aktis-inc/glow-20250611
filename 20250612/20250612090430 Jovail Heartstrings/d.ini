[verse 1]
Zindagi ke raaste anjaane
Dil ki dhadkan, sukoon paane

[Pre-Chorus]
Rukte nahi, kadam chale
Sapno ki ore, mann me jale

[Chorus]
oooo 
iiiiii
हम त चल परदस
गूँजता साज

[Bridge - Soul's Whisper]
Aangan ki yaad, saath chale
Dil mein bas, bas khilte phool

[verse 2]
Saathiya ki yaad, pal pal mein
Khushbu si bikhre, in hawaaon mein

[outro - Zephyr's Embrace]
ssssss
ooooo
zephyr... pardes... साज... सफर
