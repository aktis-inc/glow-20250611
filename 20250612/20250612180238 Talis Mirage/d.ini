lyrics = [intro - Ethereal Echoes]
shhhhhaaaa ooooo

[verse 1 - Desert Whispers]  
Sitar strings hum, tales untold  
Rhythms ancient, yet bold  
Voices rise, night unfolds  
iiiiiiiii

[Pre-Chorus - Mirage Dance]  
ooooo  
Mystic sands, where dreams collide  
In this trance, secrets hide

[Chorus - Celestial Pulse]  
wooooooo  
Mirage in sight, dance in flight  
Talis, guide us through the night

[Bridge - Horizon Glow]  
Voices blend, cultures weave (ahh!)  
In the dusk, visions breathe (ok!)  
ahhhhhh shshshsh  
[echoed call]

[verse 2 - Rhythmic Journey]  
Tabla beats, heart's own song  
Mystic paths, where we belong  
Ever forward, echoes strong

[outro - Talis Mirage]  
sssssshhhh oooooo

[outro fade]
