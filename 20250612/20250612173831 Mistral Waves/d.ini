lyrics = [intro]

[verse 1]
Waves roll in, sun dips low
Colors dance where the palm trees grow
oooooo  

[chorus]
Feel the warmth, let it flow
Mistral breezes, let them show
iiiiii  

[verse 2]
Rhythms pulse in the evening light
Laughter echoes, stars take flight
ssshhhh  

[bridge]
In this moment, time stands still
Hearts align, with a gentle thrill
woooooo  

[outro]
Breathe in deep, let it go
Mistral waves, ebb and flow
oooooo]
