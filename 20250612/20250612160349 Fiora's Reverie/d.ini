[verse – Whispering Winds]
Softly through the forest, whispers of the past
Gentle echoes calling, memories that last

[chorus – Ethereal Dance]
ooooo aaaaa
Flowing through the twilight, dreams come alive
iiiiii ooooo

[bridge – Timeless Stream]
In the river's song, time stands still
Mystical and endless, hearts fulfill

[verse – Nature's Lullaby]
Stars above are watching, guiding through the night
Harmony in silence, everything feels right

[outro – Fiora's Reverie]
ooooo iiiiii
Dreams in the river's embrace, timeless and free
oooo aaaa
