[verse 1 – Rhythmic Flow]
In the city lights, tradition calls  
Echoes of beats, where the new world falls  
Ravik leads with the heart of gold  
Stories untold, rhythms unfold  
zzzzzzhhhhhh  

[Pre-Chorus – Urban Pulse]  
(heartbeat thump)  
ooooo  
Between the past and future's glow  
Every pulse, a story to show  

[Chorus – Cultural Groove]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii  

[Bridge - Fusion Dreams]  
I am the bridge, between the worlds (let's go!)  
Pathway of sound, where stories swirl (ok!)  
Ahhh shhhhhh  
[echoed breath]

[verse 2]
Dance with the rhythm, feel the tide  
Traditional spirit, with modern pride  
Too alive to be confined  

[dynamic drop]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[whispered echoes] rhythm… fusion… groove… (oo-yeah!)

[outro - Ravik Groove]
