lyrics = [intro - gentle awakening]

[verse 1 – Whispering Hope]
In the silence, I find grace  
Through the shadows, light embrace  
ooooo aaaaaa  
iiiiii

[Pre-Chorus – Heart's Call]  
[soft echo]
oooooo  
Guide my steps, in Your light  
Every moment, in Your sight  

[Chorus – Brio's Reverie]  
wooooo  
iiiiii aaaaa  
Your love, my anchor, my guide  

[Bridge - Spirit's Dance]  
Lift my soul, beyond the sky (rise up!)  
In Your arms, I'm truly alive (oh yeah!)  
ahhhhhh shhhhhhh  
[echoed breath]

[verse 2]
In Your presence, fear subsides  
Every tear, You dry inside  
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[outro - Brio Reverie]
