[beat drop]
oooo eeee iiiii
[verse 1]
In the city lights, I rise
Stars align, no compromise
oooooo oooooo
[chorus]
Solara, we conquer the night
Feel the rhythm, take the flight
oooo eeee iiiii
[bridge]
Echoes of triumph, whispers of dreams
In this world, nothing's as it seems
[verse 2]
Moving forward, never looking back
On this path, we stay on track
[drop]
oooo eeee iiiii
[outro]
Solara, guiding through the dark
A new chapter, we embark
