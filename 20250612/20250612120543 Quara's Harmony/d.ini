lyrics = [intro chant]

[verse 1]
Rhythms of the earth, whispers of the soul  
Harmonies unfolding, stories yet untold  
ooooo aaaaaa

[Pre-Chorus – Echoes of the Past]
Chanting through the ages, voices in the wind  
Vibrations calling, where it all begins  
iiiiii oooooo

[Chorus – Sacred Pulse]
Feel the beat, heart's embrace  
Lost in time, sacred space  
ooooo aaaaaa

[Bridge - Celestial Dance]
Dance of the cosmos, stars align  
Melody divine, timeless sign  
shhhhhh aaaaaa

[verse 2]
Threads of memory, woven in the air  
Songs of the ancients, everywhere  
ooooo iiiiii

[outro - Quara's Harmony]
Eternal echoes, fading slow  
In harmony, we let go  
iiiiii oooooo
