lyrics = [intro - ethereal rise]

[verse - whispering echoes]
Climbing through the mist, where shadows fall
Dreams unfold, a silent call
ooooo ooooo  

[Pre-Chorus - Ascent]
Through the clouds, a path untold
Every heartbeat echoes bold
iiiiiiiii

[Chorus - Hilltop Vision]
Rise and rise, to the summit high
Where secrets blend with the sky
ahhhhhhhhhh

[Bridge - Dreamwave]
In the light, shadows dance
Every step, a timeless trance
oooo eeee ahhhh

[outro - ethereal descent]
