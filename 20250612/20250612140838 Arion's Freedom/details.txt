lyrics = [intro build]

[verse]
Beyond the edge, I find my voice  
Winds of change, my heart's own choice  
Through the storm, I rise anew  

[chorus]
oooooo  
Freedom calls, echoes wide   
I am more than fate's design  
iiiiiiii  

[bridge]
Breaking chains that held me down  
Flight begins, no turning round  
Ahhhhhh  

[guitar solo]

[verse 2]
On this path, I carve my name  
In the sky, an endless flame  
Every note, a story told  

[outro]
ooooooooo  
Echoes fade, yet I remain  
Free at last, in my own way  
[fade out]
