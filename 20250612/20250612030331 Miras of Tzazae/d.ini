lyrics = [intro desert wind]

[verse 1 – Mirage Dance]
In the sands, echoes call
Whispers of the night, stories untold
oooooo

[Chorus – Rhythm of the Dunes]
Dance with the stars
In the night, we are alive
iiiiii

[Bridge – Oasis Dream]
Under the moon, dreams flow
Heartbeat of the earth, we follow
ahhhhhh

[verse 2]
Footprints in the sand, trace the past
In the rhythm, we find our path
oooooo

[outro – Fading Mirage]
iiiiiiiii oooooo
Desert dreams, never fade
