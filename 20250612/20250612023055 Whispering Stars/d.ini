lyrics = [intro - starry night]
(vocals humming) aaaaa ooooooo

[verse]
तारों की चुप्पी में
आवाज़ें गूंजती हैं
शांति का संगीत
दिल की गहराई में

[chorus]
oooooo
सितारे फुसफुसाते हैं
oooooo

[bridge - night whispers]
आकाश के नीचे
सपने तैरते हैं
मौन की लहरें

[outro - gentle fade]
(vocals humming) oooooo aaaaa
