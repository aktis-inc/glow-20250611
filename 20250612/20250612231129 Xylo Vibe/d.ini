lyrics = [intro]
ooooooo

[verse]
In the city lights, we find our beat  
Echoes of a distant dream, in the street  
Rhythms call, under the sky's embrace  
We dance through the night, in this sacred space  
zzzzzzz

[chorus]
ooooo  
Xylo vibe, where the heart aligns  
Feel the pulse, in the endless lines

[bridge]
Through the neon glow, stories unfold  
In every step, a tale retold  
woooohhh   

[verse]
Whispers in the air, carry us high  
In the city's hum, we touch the sky  
Together we rise, in the silent night  
Bound by the rhythm, in the fading light  
ahhhhhhh

[outro]
Xylo vibe, we drift and sway  
In the city's heart, we find our way  
iiiiiiii]
