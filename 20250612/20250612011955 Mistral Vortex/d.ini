lyrics = [intro build-up]

[verse 1 – Neon Flow]  
Pulse of the night, electric hum  
iiiiiiiiii  
Cascading lights, rhythm of the drum  

[drop - Vortex Surge]  
wooooooo  
ooooo  

[chorus - Synthwave Drive]  
Catch the breeze, in neon dreams  
oooo aaaa  
iiiiii  

[bridge - Urban Echo]  
Lost in the sound, we are found  
Echos in the streets, rhythms abound  
shhhh ooo  

[verse 2 – Electric Pulse]  
Dancing shadows, city glow  
A symphony of lights, let it flow  

[drop - Final Descent]  
wooooo ooooo  

[outro - Mistral Drift]  
iiii aaaa  
Fade into the horizon, carried by the sound
