lyrics = [intro riff]
(Heavy breathing) In the glow of the city, we rise
(Whispered rap) Bass and strings collide
ooooo iiiiii

[verse 1 – Electric Surge]
On the streets, the echoes flow
Trap and roll, we own the show
Through the night, our voices grow
We are the rhythm, the power, the glow
zzzzzzzz

[Chorus – Sonic Clash]
woooooooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiii

[Bridge - Pulse Shift]
Rap and rock, we break the mold (let's go!)
In this rush, we find our soul (yeah!)
Ahhhhhh shh shh shh  
[echoed beat]

[verse 2]
Electric storms in our veins
Rhythms wild, breaking chains
In the night, our anthem reigns

[outro - Sable Rhapsody]
Ssshhh ooo  
[distorted echo] rise… collide… ignite… (oh-yeah!)
