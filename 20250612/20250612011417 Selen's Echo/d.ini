lyrics = [intro - beating heart]

[verse 1 - Echoes of Tradition]
In the fields, where tales are spun  
Voices rise with the morning sun  
oooooo iiiii

[Pre-Chorus - Pulse of the Past]
Tradition calls, a rhythmic dance  
Between the past and present's trance  
ahhh ooo aaa

[Chorus - Vibrant Fusion]
Eeeeeee echoes shiiiine  
In the heart, we intertwine  
oooooo

[Bridge - Modern Beat]
Ancient paths in neon glow  
Stories told in beats that flow  
zzzzzz

[verse 2 - Rhythmic Journey]
Across the lands, the music flies  
Bridges built through ancient ties  
shhhh ooooo

[outro - Selen's Echo]
A fusion sound, where dreams align  
In Selen's Echo, stars will shine  
ahhhh eeee]
