(clapping, gentle breeze)  
iiiiiiiii  

[verse 1 – Unity Call]  
Voices rise, in the warmth of day  
Hands reach out, in the dance we sway  
Harmony flows, like a river's song  
Together strong, where we belong  
oooooo

[Pre-Chorus – Spirit's Rise]  
Rhythm beats, heart in time  
Echoes of peace, voices chime  

[Chorus – Joyful Harmony]  
iiiiiiiii  
We sing as one, in the sun  
iiiiiiiii  

[Bridge - Soul Connection]  
In every voice, a story told  
In every step, a bond unfolds  
ahhhhhh

[outro - Iveris Harmony]  
oooooo  
(whispered unity) Together, forever
