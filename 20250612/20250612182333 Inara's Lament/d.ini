[verse 1 – Silent Yearning]  
In the twilight, shadows dance  
Heartbeat echoes, a lost romance  
iiii ooooo  

[Pre-Chorus – Gentle Echo]  
Whispers in the wind, soft and low  
Dreams of a love, long ago  

[Chorus – Inara's Call]  
woooooo  
Hearts cry, longing for more  
iiiiiiiee  

[Bridge – Echoed Reflection]  
Time stands still, in the silence  
A moment forever, lost in its defiance  
ahhhh ooooo  

[verse 2 – Fading Light]  
Memories drift in the fading light  
Stars above, guide me through the night  

[outro – Inara's Lament]  
Softly now, the night draws near  
Inara's voice, so clear  
ooooo iiiii
