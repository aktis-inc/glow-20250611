[verse 1 - Soft Whispers]
Ocean's breath, a gentle call  
Lost in waves, where dreams fall  
zephyyyyyyyyyrrrrrr  
zzzzzzzzzzzzzz

[chorus - Breeze Echo]
Floating high, on whispered air  
Softly spoken, everywhere  
oooooo

[bridge - Reflective Drift]
Through the clouds, where light bends  
In the echoes, time suspends  
aaaaaaa

[outro - Fading Light]
Zephyr's song, fades to night  
Dreams and echoes take their flight  
woooooo  
ssssssssssss
