[verse]
Echoes in the night, spirits dance
Tradition flows in every chance
Guitar strings call, beneath the stars
Harmony binds, no matter how far
zzzzzzzz

[Chorus - Yoruba Vibe]
oooooo
Dance with the echoes, feel the beat
In the heart of the night, life is sweet
eeeeee

[Bridge - Mystic Flow]
Chants rise, in the moon's glow
Guided by the rhythm, onward we go
aaaaa ooooo

[verse]
Stories told in ancient song
With each step, where we belong
Melodies weave through the air
In Oberon's embrace, we share

[outro - rhythmic fade]
ooooo zzzzz
