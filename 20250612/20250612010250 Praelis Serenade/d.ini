lyrics = [intro]
(soft hum) iiiiiiiiiii
oooooo

[verse 1]
In the silence where we meet
Echoes of love, bittersweet
Whispers of a dream, so near
Heartbeats loud, but no fear

[Chorus]
Hold me close, under the stars
Our serenade, across the scars
Paaaaa iiiiiiiiiii

[bridge]
Weaving tales, of days gone by
In your eyes, the truth, no lie
Ooooooo aaaaaaa

[outro]
Together, our story unfolds
In the night, where love holds
(soft hum) iiiiiiiiiii
