lyrics = [intro - Electric Surge]

[verse 1 - Neon Pulse]
City lights, they shimmer cold
Heartbeat echoes, stories told
iiiiiiii oooh

[Chorus - Overdrive]
Rushing through the veins of night
Feel the storm, electric might

[verse 2 - Urban Tension]
Concrete dreams and shadowed tracks
Every step, no turning back
zzzzzz

[Bridge - Sonic Clash]
Guitars wail, the sirens call
Feel the rush, never fall
ooooo iiiiii

[outro - Fading Echo]
Neon fades, silence creeps
In the dark, the city sleeps
woooooo
