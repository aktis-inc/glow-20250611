[verse 1]
Engines roar, lights ablaze
Speed's the game, we're in a chase

Feel the rush, hear the sound
City's pulse, all around

[Chorus - Neon Race]

Druva drive, never slow
Racing through, endless glow

Adrenaline, hearts collide
On this road, we won't hide
zzzzzz iiiii

Brick by brick, we build the scene
In this race, we're the dream

[outro - Finish Line]
shhhhh
Neon fades, victory's sweet
In the night, we repeat
