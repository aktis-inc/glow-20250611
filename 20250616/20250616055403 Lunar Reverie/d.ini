lyrics = [intro]
Beneath the moon's embrace  
whispers dance in the night  

[verse]  
Stars weave tales of old  
Soft winds sing of love untold  

[chorus]  
oooooo  
Lunar dreams, hearts collide  
Gentle tides, love's guiding light  

[bridge]  
In shadows, secrets unfold  
Eternal bonds, stories retold  
ahhhhhhh  

[outro]  
Silent echoes, moonlit grace  
Fading whispers in the starry space
