[verse]
In the city, lights are calling
Ravine whispers, shadows falling
oooooo iiiiiii

[chorus - echo dance]
Dance with echoes, in the rain
Neon dreams, break the chain
oooooo

[bridge - pulse wave]
Time flows, retro glow
In this ravine, we find our show
aaaaaa

[outro - fading light]
Echoes linger, in the night
Ravine echoes, taking flight
oooo iiiiiii
