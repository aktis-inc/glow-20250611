Neon dreams, whispers in the night  
Footsteps echo, chasing the light

In the heart of the city, we find our way  
Every corner a story, come what may

[Chorus - Aeris Vibe]  
oooooo ahhhh  
Lights and laughter, we thrive  
Together in the Aeris vibe

[Bridge - Urban Dance]  
We move, we sway, under the moon  
Our hearts in sync, a perfect tune

Stories unfold with every glance  
In the city's dance, we take a chance  
woooooo

oooooo  
Fade into the night, dreams take flight
