iiii oooo  

[verse 1]  
Hati berbisik, rinduku dalam
Bayangmu hadir, di setiap detak
sssshhhhh

[chorus]  
Rimba ini, saksi bisu
Rinduku, bersamamu

[bridge]  
Jejak langkah, di tanah ini
Menyatu dalam, desir angin  
ahhhhhh

Suara alam, terapung dalam
Mimpi kita, kan terulang

Rimba ini, tempat kita
Rinduku, selamanya  
ooooooo  
iiiiiii
