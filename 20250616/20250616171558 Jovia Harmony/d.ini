lyrics = [intro - Soft Glow]

[piano & strings]

[verse 1 - Whispered Echoes]
In the silence, whispers call  
Hearts entwine like shadows fall  
oooooo iiiiiiiii

[chorus - Celestial Dance]
oooo ahhhh  
Together in this gentle trance  
Stars align in a loving glance  

[bridge - Resonant Souls]
Beyond the night, where dreams reside  
Feelings bloom and never hide  
shhhhhh 

[verse 2 - Tender Waves]
Through the echoes, we find our way  
Holding tight, night meets the day  
ooooooooo iiiiiii 

[outro - Luminous Fade]
[soft vocal harmonies]
In the light, we softly stay  
Embrace the dawn's tender play
