lyrics = [intro - gentle breeze]

[verse 1 – Moonlit Whispers]
In the garden where dreams unfold
Petals weave stories untold
ahhhh oooooooh

[Chorus – Serenade Under Stars]
Hearts in harmony, night embraces
Love's sweet melody, time erases
ooooooooo

[verse 2 – Blossoms and Promises]
Starlit paths, two souls align
Bound by whispers of the vine

[Bridge - Enchanted Interlude]
Dancing shadows, soft caress
Moments captured, nothing less
ahhhhhhhh

[Chorus – Serenade Under Stars]
Hearts in harmony, night embraces
Love's sweet melody, time erases
iiiiiiiiii

[outro - fading echoes]
Whispers fade but love remains
In the moonlit garden's domains
