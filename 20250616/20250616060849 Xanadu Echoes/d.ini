[verse - Echoing Past]
Softly, the strings tell tales
iiiiiiiii  
Whispers of a time afar  
ooooooo  
In the heart, stories reside

[chorus - Xanadu Calls]
Eeeeeeeechooooes  
Across the valleys wide  
oooooo  
In every corner, dreams abide  
iiiiiiaaaaa

[bridge - Harmonious Waves]
Harmony flows, gentle and wide  
Breezes carry, secrets untold  
ahhhhhhh

In the colors of the dawn  
iiiiii  
A melody born anew  
ooooo  
In the light, shadows dance

[outro - Fading Echoes]
Whispers fade, but not the song  
ooooo  
In Xanadu, echoes belong  
iiiiiiiiii]
