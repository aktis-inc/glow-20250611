lyrics = [intro - Whispers of Light]

[verse - Silent Grace]
Softly the light falls, through sacred glass
In stillness, hearts find their rest
Echoes of peace, in whispered prayer
Uplift the soul, in gentle embrace

[chorus - Celestial Harmony]
Aaaahhh  
Oooooh  
Serenity flows, like gentle streams

[bridge - Sacred Reflection] 
In quietude, find solace  
Beneath the vaulted sky  
Shadows dance, with holy light  
Aaaaaa oooooo iiiii

[outro - Umbria's Embrace]
Soft echoes fade, in holy halls  
Peace lingers, in silent grace  
Whispers of light, eternal and free
