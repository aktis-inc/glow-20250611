lyrics = [intro - Majestic Rise]
(Orchestral swells)  
(Choir) Ahhhhhhhhhh

[verse - Hero's Call]  
In the shadow of giants,  
Light pierces the veil,  
Destiny weaves,  
In an endless tale.

[chorus - Ascend]  
oooooo  
Harmis rise,  
Through the night,  
Into the sky,  
Harmonies fly.

[bridge - Battle Cry]  
Drums echo,  
Hearts ignite,  
Strength in unity,  
In the fight.

[verse - Dawn's Arrival]  
Embers glow,  
Stars align,  
Future's forge,  
In the divine.

[outro - Epic Closure]  
Ahhhhhhh  
oooooo  
(Choir fades)  
(Instrumental descent)
