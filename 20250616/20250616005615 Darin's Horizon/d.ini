lyrics = [intro - Gentle Waves]

[verse - Morning Light]
Soft whispers of the dawn
In the horizon's gentle sway
Dreams linger in the air
Floating like clouds of grey
oooooo iiiiiii

[Chorus - Rising Sun]
Beneath the sky's embrace
Hope dances with the breeze
In every silent trace
A symphony of ease
aaaaahhhhhh

[Bridge - Serene Echo]
In the heart of the sea
Where dreams dare to roam
Whispers call to me
In this place I call home
shhhhhhh

[outro - Tranquil Tide]
Ripples fade away
In the soft glow of day
Darin's horizon
Guides our gentle way
ooooo aaaaaa
