lyrics = [intro - city echoes]
(Whispered voice) Streets are calling
(Whispered voice) Follow the beat, feel the rhythm

[verse 1 – Urban Pulse]
Night falls, lights flicker on
Concrete jungle, where dreams are drawn
Feel the beat, it guides my path
Through shadows deep, I find my craft

[chorus – Yara's Challenge]
oooo aaaa oooo
Step to the rhythm, heart in motion
Feel the challenge, rise with emotion

[bridge - Neon Flow]
In the glow, I find my way
Through the noise, I hear my say
ahhhh oooo

[verse 2 – Grit and Grind]
Pavement echoes, stories untold
Through every beat, my truth unfolds
Resilient heart, in this urban sprawl
iiiiiiii oooooo

[outro - Echoing Streets]
whispered echoes, fading light
City's heart, beats through the night
