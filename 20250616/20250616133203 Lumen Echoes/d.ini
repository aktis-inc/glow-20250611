lyrics = [intro echo]

[verse – Twilight Hues]
City's glow, whispers through the night
Dreams unfold in the gentle light

[soft chorus]
oooooo
iiiiii

[verse – Reflected Dreams]
Neon signs, stories never told
Echoes dance in the shadows' hold

[Chorus – Lumen Flow]
oooooo
iiiiii 

[Bridge – Echoes Unite]
Waves of sound, carry us away
In this night, dreams begin to sway

[outro – Fading Light]
shhhhh
oooooo
