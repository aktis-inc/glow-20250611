lyrics = [intro - Neon Glow]
ooooo aaaaaa

[verse 1 - Whispered Affection]  
In the city's heart, we find a place  
Where shadows dance, and moments trace  
Soft whispers in the rain-soaked air  
Our dreams alight, beyond compare  

[Pre-Chorus - Embrace]  
ooooo iiiiii  
In every glance, a universe  
With silent words, our hearts converse  

[Chorus - Wynze of Love]  
wooo iiiiiii  
Our love's a light, a guiding dove  
In neon's glow, we rise above  

[Bridge - Timeless Ties]  
Hand in hand, through the night we roam  
In this endless city, we find our home  
ahhhhh aaaaah  

[outro - Fading Lights]  
ooooo iiiii  
Our love's echo, a gentle hum  
As night falls, our hearts drum
