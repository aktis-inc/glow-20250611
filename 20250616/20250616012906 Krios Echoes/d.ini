oooooo eeeee

[verse - Echoes of the Past]  
Chants of ages, winds of old  
Mystical paths, stories untold

Voices rise, through the sky  
Echoes dance, spirits fly

Ancient rhythms, heartbeats align  
In the silence, secrets entwine  
shhhh oooo

[outro - Fade into Time]  
ooooo eeeee  
Chants and whispers, fade away  
Krios echoes, in the sway
