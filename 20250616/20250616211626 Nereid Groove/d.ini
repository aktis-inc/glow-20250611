[verse 1]
Voices in the breeze
Dance with the sea

[Pre-Chorus - Tropical Echo]
oooo oooo
Feel the rhythm, feel the call
Underneath the palm trees

[Chorus - Nereid Dance]
iiiiiiii
Dance the night away
With the ocean's sway

[Bridge - Sunset Vibe]
Colors in the sky
Heartbeat of the night

[verse 2]
Step to the beat
Feel the sand beneath
oooooo

[glitch fade]
oooo iiiii

[outro - Groove Finale]
