iiiiiiii

[verse 1 – Whispered Touch]  
In the quiet corners, shadows dance  
Your gaze, a gentle storm, so vast  
ssshhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Velvet Night]  
woooooo  
Soft breaths echo, in the velvet night  
Hearts entwined, in silent flight  

[Chorus – Affection's Drift]  
oooooo  
iiiiiiii  
Emotions float, like gentle tides  
Held in the hues, where dreams reside  

[Bridge - Ethereal Embrace]  
In the mist, our secrets blend  
Time suspends, in love's soft hand  
ahhhhhh

[outro - Fading Light]  
Silent whispers fade to grey  
In twilight's arms, we gently sway  
oooooo  
iiiiiiii
