(melody whispers) ooooo  
(soulful call) आओ आओ

[verse - Echo of Hills]
In the mist, a song is carried
Tales of time, softly sung
oooooo iiiiii

Sway with the breeze
Whispered dreams, ancient and free

[bridge - Wind's Embrace]
Feel the earth, the pulse beneath
Stories untold, in every breath

[outro - Yara's Echoes]
iiiiiiii ooooooo
(shimmering fade)
