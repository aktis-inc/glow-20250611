lyrics = [intro - City Echoes]
(soft male voice) Streetlights whisper, secrets unfold  
oooooo  

[verse 1 – Urban Drift]  
In shadows of the skyline, I find my way  
Silent echoes guide me through the night  
Thoughts like rain, falling soft and slow  
iiiiiiii  

[Chorus – Neon Dreams]  
woooooo  
Through the haze, clarity shines  
Beneath the neon glow, I see  

[Bridge - Midnight Thoughts]  
City's breath, a constant hum  
In this maze, I’m never lost  
ahhhhhhh  

[verse 2 – Reflections]  
Mirrors of the past, in each puddle's gleam  
Steps resonate, a rhythm of my own  
Lost in thought, but never alone  
shhhhhhh  

[outro - Vireo Vibes]  
(fading whispers) Secrets of the night… ooo-yeah…
