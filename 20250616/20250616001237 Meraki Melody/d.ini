lyrics = [intro - gentle awakening]
oooooo iiiii

[verse 1 - Rising Dawn]
Di lembah hijau, cerita terjalin
Angin membisikkan kisah lama  
Dalam denting bambu, hati tenang  
Merdu suara, jiwa melayang

[chorus - Harmony of Heart]  
wooo iiiii  
Melodi membelai, dalam jiwa membakar  
Damai terasa, dalam harmoni

[bridge - Whispering Leaves]  
Angin berbisik, rahasia terdalam  
Bersama alam, kita bernyanyi  
ooooooo aaaaah

[verse 2 - Sunset Glow]  
Dalam senja, warna berpendar  
Langit merona, cinta terasa  
Dalam suara, kita berpadu

[outro - Echo of Tradition]  
iiiiii ooooo
Merdu mengalun, cerita abadi
