[verse]

Feel the rhythm, lights ignite  
In the city, we take flight  
oooooo  
nnnnnn

[chorus – Release Wave]  
Dance in nebula's embrace  
Heartbeats sync in this space  

[bridge]  
Energy, flowing free  
Chase the night endlessly  
ahhhhh

[verse 2]  
Neon dreams, vibrant streams  
Echoes of our whispered gleams  
shhhhh

[outro – Fade to Dawn]  
oooooo  
nnnnnn  
Release yourself, night moves on
