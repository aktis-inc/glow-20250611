lyrics = [intro - Twilight Whisper]

[ethereal hum]
ahhhhh oooooo

[verse 1 – Serene Echoes]
Whispers of dusk, in golden hues
Dreams awaken, softly renewed
Floating on echoes, gently we move
oooooooo

[chorus – Kairo's Call]
Luminous night, stars align
In your presence, softly entwined
ahhhhhhh

[bridge - Celestial Drift]
Time slows, as moments blend
In the silence, peace descends
ahhhh ahhh

[outro - Whisper's End]
ooooo iiiiiiii
