El sol despierta, llamas del ritmo  
Pasos que vuelan, sobre la arena  
oooooo

[Chorus – Vibrant Pulse]  
Harmonia vibra, alma en vuelo  
oooo

[Bridge - Neon Horizon] 
Sombras bailan, luces se encienden  
oooo ahhhh

Corazones laten, juntos al compás  
El mundo gira, bajo nuestras alas  
iiiiii

[outro - Sunset Groove]  
oooo iiiii  
fin de día, inicio eterno
