[verse - Ancient Call]
In the shadow of the mountains, echoes rise
Through the mist, the old tales breathe

[build-up - Wind Surge]
ooooo iiiii aaaaaa
Drums of the earth, heartbeats align

[Chorus - Time's Call]
Rise, ooo, rise, iiiii
With the storm, we march

[Bridge - Whispered Legends]
Silent stones, speak in dreams
oooo aaaa

[outro - Mistral's Echo]
iiiiii ooooo aaaaaa
