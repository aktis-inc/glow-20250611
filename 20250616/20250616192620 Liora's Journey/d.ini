[verse - The First Steps]
Gentle breeze, whispers of dawn  
In the distance, dreams are drawn  
Liora's path begins anew

[chorus - Melody of Hope]
ooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiii  
Children's laughter, echoes wide  
In this journey, we abide

[bridge - Magical Interlude]
Strings soar high, above the sky  
Piano chords, where dreams lie  
Ahhhhhh

[verse - Steps of Wonder]
Footsteps light on gravel ground  
In each note, a promise found  
Liora leads, with gentle sound

[outro - Journey's End]
oooo  
Harmony in every stride  
In her heart, the dreams reside
