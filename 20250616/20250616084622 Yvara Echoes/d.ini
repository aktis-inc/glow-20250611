lyrics = [intro - Vibrant Echoes]
(Soft tabla rhythm)  
Gentle winds carry whispers  
(Orchestral swell)  
Sitar strings sing tales untold  
iiiiiiiii  
oooooo  

[verse 1 - Timeless Dance]  
In colors bright, we find our past  
Rhythms beat, hearts hold fast  
Tradition's whisper, future's call  
A tapestry where stories fall  
zzzzzzhhhhh  

[Pre-Chorus - Soul's Embrace]  
[soft instrumental]  
ooooo  
Between the threads of time we weave  
Each note a story, each breath a dream  

[Chorus - Echoing Dreams]  
woooooo  
iiiiiiiii  
Our voices rise in harmony  
A timeless song, our legacy  

[Bridge - Ethereal Fusion]  
We stand on the edge of then and now (forward!)  
In every note, love's vow (ok!)  
Ahhhhhh shhhhhh  
[echoed breath]  

[verse 2 - Heritage's Pulse]  
Every beat a memory's dance  
In every glance, a second chance  
We hold the past, yet walk the new  

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[distorted whisper] echoes… timeless… journey… (oh-yes!)

[outro - Yvara Echoes]
