lyrics = [intro – Neon Awakening]

[verse]
Sparks hum with the morning light
Rhythms call from ancient night
ooooo aaaa

[chorus – Ethereal Dance]
Dance through time, across the sky
Whispers of a dream gone by

[bridge – Lotus Bloom]
Floating on a breeze of change
Echoes of the past arrange

[Pre-Chorus – Harmonious Flow]
iiiii oooo 
Unseen threads, binding dreams
In the city's vibrant streams

[Chorus – Ethereal Dance]
Dance through time, across the sky
Whispers of a dream gone by

[outro – Neon Reverie]
