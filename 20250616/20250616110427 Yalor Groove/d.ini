[verse]
In the city where the lights never fade
Rhythms flow on streets we pave
ooooooo iiiiiiii

[chorus]
Feel the beat, it’s alive, it’s our way
Dance with me, through the night, every sway
wooooooo aaaaa

[bridge]
Neon dreams in our eyes, guide the night
Every step, every move, feels so right
zzzzzzhhhhh ooooo

[outro]
Yalor groove, let it play, let it play
In the heart of the night, we stay
