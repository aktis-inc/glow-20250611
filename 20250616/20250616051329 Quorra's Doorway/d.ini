[verse]
Bajo la luz suave,  
un susurro en la brisa,  
iiiiiiiii  

[pre-chorus]
ooooooo  
el umbral invita,  
siente el latido,  

[chorus]
Quorra's puerta abre,  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiii  
oooooo  
donde el alma baila,  

[bridge]
puedes escuchar,  
un eco del pasado,  
sss  
oooo  

[outro - Fade into Silence]
iiiiii  
oooooo  
la puerta se cierra,  
pero el alma permanece
