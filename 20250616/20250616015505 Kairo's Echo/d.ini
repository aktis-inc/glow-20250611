lyrics = [intro soft strum]

[verse 1]
Gentle winds carry whispers
Of stories untold  
Kairo walks the path  
Where dreams softly unfold

[Pre-Chorus]
Beneath the twilight sky  
A melody takes flight  
iiiiiiiiii   
ooooooo

[Chorus]
Kairo's echo, through the night  
Lost in shadows, finds the light  
wooooo

[Bridge]
In the silence, truth revealed  
Every step, a scar healed  
ahhhh ooooo

[outro]
Fading echoes, softly sway  
Under stars, dreams find their way  
oooo iiiii
