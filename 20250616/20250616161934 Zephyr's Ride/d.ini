[verse]

Riding through the city lights  
Energized and bold tonight  
ooooooo aaaaaaa

[Pre-Chorus – Edge of Night]

Tires burn on endless streets  
Neon dreams beneath our feet  
iiiii ooooo

[Chorus – Zephyr's Call]

Feel the wind, let it guide  
On this journey, side by side  
oooooo iiiii

[Bridge - Electric Horizon]

Lights flash by in vibrant streams  
Chasing shadows, chasing dreams  
ahhhhhh

[verse 2]

Speeding onward, never slow  
In the night, we become the glow  
zzzzzz zzzz

[outro - Zephyr's Ride]
