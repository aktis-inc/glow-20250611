lyrics = [intro - nostalgic hum]

[verse 1 - Time's Reflection]
In the glow of neon dreams
Echoes whisper through the seams
iiiiiii ooooooo

[Chorus - Heart's Horizon]
oooooo
Zephyr winds, carry us away
Through the corridors of yesterday

[Bridge - Timeless Dance]
Steps align with shadows' grace
In the night, we find our place

[verse 2 - Echoed Memories]
Past and future intertwine
In a dance that feels divine

[outro - Fade to Tomorrow]
oooooo ahhhh
Whispered echoes, fading slow
Into the dawn, where dreams grow
