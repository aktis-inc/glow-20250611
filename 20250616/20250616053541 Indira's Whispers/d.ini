lyrics = [intro - synth pads bloom]
aaaaaahhhhhhh
oooooooooooo

[verse 1 - soft rhythm begins]
Silent glances across the room
A language only hearts can speak
Promises whispered in the gloom
Searching for a hidden peak
iiiiiiiii

[Pre-Chorus - build up]
Breath catches like a tangled thread
Every beat a pulse of hope
Moving closer, words unsaid
On this shimmering, golden slope

[Chorus - energetic pulse]
Indira's whispers fill the air
A symphony only we can hear
Beyond all doubt, beyond all care
Holding you oh so near
mmmmmmmmmmmmm

[tabla breakdown - intricate and fast]
(percussive sounds)

[verse 2 - melody returns]
Fingers trace a moonlit path
Through the garden of the soul
Escaping sorrow's aftermath
Making our two halves whole

[Pre-Chorus - build up]
Shadows lengthen, colors fade
But our light shines ever bright
In this world that we have made
Bathed in the softest night

[Chorus - energetic pulse]
Indira's whispers fill the air
A symphony only we can hear
Beyond all doubt, beyond all care
Holding you oh so near
ooooooooooooooooo

[sitar solo - melodic and expressive]

[bridge - reflective]
Is this a dream, or something true?
This feeling, boundless and deep
Lost in the magic of me and you
Secrets the starlight will keep
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

[drop - rhythmic intensity returns]

[outro - fade with synth]
Whispers fading
Into the night
aaaaaaaaaaaaaah
(soft sitar note)
