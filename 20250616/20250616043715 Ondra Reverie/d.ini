lyrics = [intro rhythm]

[verse 1 – Dance of Colors]
In the heartbeat of the city, echoes of the past
Melodies weave through the night, a tapestry vast
ooooo

[chorus – Fusion Fire]
Dance, dance, to the rhythm of time
oooo
Hands unite, hearts align

[verse 2 – Timeless Whispers]
Strings of the past, woven with today
Voices rise, in a harmonious sway
aaaaa

[bridge – Echoes of Harmony]
Tradition meets the electric soul
Feel the fusion, let it take control
wooooo

[outro – Ondra Reverie]
ooooo
iiiiii
In a reverie, we find the light
