(Soft guitar strum) Sunlit mornings whisper tales

ooooo iiiiii

[verse 1 - Open Path]
Walking down the winding trails
Stories carried on the breeze
Every step a new discovery
In the vastness of the land

[chorus - Heartland Echo]
ooooo
Fields of gold, hearts unfold
Every whisper, a story told
iiiiii

[bridge - Horizon's Call]
Beyond the hills, where the sky meets earth
Dreams take flight, a new rebirth
ahhhhhh
ooooo

[verse 2 - Echoed Memories]
Footprints fade but memories stay
In the soil where dreams are sown
Every heartbeat feels the rhythm
Of the land that calls us home

[outro - Meadow Trails]
ooooo iiiiii
(Synthesized voice) In the meadow, we find our way
(Synthesized voice) Trails of life, forever stay
ooooo iiiiii
[soft fade]
