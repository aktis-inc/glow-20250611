lyrics = [intro - Distant Echoes]
(Guitar hum)  
Softly through the night
Lonesome streetlights call  
ooooooh

[verse 1 – Urban Reflections]  
Walking paths of yesterday
Echoes in the shadow's play  
Memories and whispered dreams  
Fading in the neon beams

[chorus – Lumia's Call]  
woooooo  
Feel the night, the last light  
Hold the moment, let it ignite  
iiiiiiii

[bridge - Silent Echo]  
Guitar strings tell the tale  
In this city's veiled veil  
Ahhhh ooooo  

[verse 2 – Streets of Thought]  
Thoughts drift like the rain  
In the city's gentle pain  
Every step a memory  
Lost in urban reverie

[glitch build-up]  
shhhhhh oooo  

[outro - Lumia's Last Night]  
As the dawn breaks, whispers cease  
In the city's hush, find your peace  
ooooo iiiiii
