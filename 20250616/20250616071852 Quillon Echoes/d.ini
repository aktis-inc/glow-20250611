lyrics = [intro fade]
(Soft vocal hum) eeeeeee

[verse 1 – Echoes of the Past]
Memories dance in the air
Silent whispers, in the night
iiiiiii aaaa

[Chorus – Heartbeat Symphony]
Feel the pulse, feel it rise
Quillon echoes, in disguise
wooooooo

[Bridge - Soul's Embrace]
Gentle touch of yesterday
Carried on the wind's sway
ahhhh oooooo

[Pre-Chorus – Rising Tide]
oooooooooo
Ebb and flow, through the time
Heartbeats echo, in the chime

[verse 2]
Past and present intertwine
In the rhythm, love's design
shhhhhh

[outro - Quillon Echoes]
iiiiiiiiiiiii
Echoes fade into the light
Quillon's whisper, taking flight
