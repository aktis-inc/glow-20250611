lyrics = [intro - Soft Whisper]
(piano softly)  
Gentle whispers, dreams untold  
(piano softly)  
ooooooo

[verse 1 – Echoed Heartbeats]  
In the silence of the night  
I hear the echoes call my name  
Through the shadows, I will find  
A way to mend the broken frame  
oooooo

[Pre-Chorus – Rising Hope]  
[soft build-up]  
Through the storm, I see the light  
Every tear becomes a guide  

[Chorus – Lynel's Echo]  
woooooo  
iiiiiiiii  
In the echoes of the past  
I find strength at last  

[Bridge – Dream's Embrace]  
As the stars begin to fade  
I hold on to what remains  
oooooo  
sssshhhh

[verse 2]  
With each step, I rise again  
From the ashes, I'll ascend  
Heartbeats whisper through the pain  
A new chapter to begin

[outro - Fading Light]  
(piano softly)  
Dreams unfold, as echoes fade  
oooooo  
(piano softly)
