lyrics = [intro - Desert Whispers]
ooooo iiiii aaahhh

[verse 1 - Echoes of Time]  
Sands of time, beneath the stars  
Whispers carried on the breeze  
A journey unfolds in the heart  
Past and present, a dance in harmony

[Pre-Chorus - Soulful Connection]  
oooo aaaa  
Feel the rhythm, hear the pulse  
In the silence, a voice calls

[Chorus - Vibrant Harmony]  
woooo  
iiiii  
In the Petrichor, we find our way  
A melody that guides our day

[Bridge - Timeless Dance]  
Desert dreams, cosmic light  
A fusion of what's old and new  
Ahhh shhhhhh  
[echoed breath]

[verse 2]  
Stars align, guiding our path  
Traditions weave the future's thread  
In every note, a story's told  
Life's melody, a bond unbroken

[outro - Petrichor Vibes]
