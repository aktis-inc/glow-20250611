lyrics = [intro - Evening Prelude]

[smooth sax intro]

[verse - Velvet Skies]
The night whispers gently
Under the moon's soft glow
In the city’s tender heartbeat  
ooooooo

[chorus - Jazz Serenade]
Caaaaadenza echoes, iiiii
Melodies dance in twilight  
woooooo

[bridge - Midnight Interlude]
Shadows sway, stories unfold  
In the rhythm of dreams  
ahhhh

[verse 2 - Urban Lullaby]
Starlight paints the quiet streets  
With a touch of jazzed grace  
Every note a sigh of night

[outro - Dusk's Embrace]
Softly fading into whispering night  
iiiii oooooo
