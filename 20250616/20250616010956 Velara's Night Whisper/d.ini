oooooo iiiii

[verse 1 - Velvet Glow]  
Underneath the stars, shadows play  
Soft words linger, like a gentle sway  
Embrace the night, let dreams ignite  
In this moment, everything feels right  
shhhhhh iiiiii

[Chorus - Night Whisper]  
oooooo  
Whisper to me, under the moonlight  
Every moment, holding tight  
oooooo  
Velara's night, our secret flight  
iiiiii

[Bridge - Dream's Embrace]  
Silent echoes in the night  
Hearts beating in perfect sync  
In this world, we find our link  
aaaaa ooooo ahhhh

[verse 2 - City Serenade]  
City lights, painting dreams  
In your eyes, a thousand gleams  
Hold this magic, never let go  
In the night, let our spirits flow  
iiiiii shhhhh

[outro - Fading Light]  
oooooo  
iiiiii  
Velara's whisper, eternal glow  
shhhhhh
