oooooo  
iiiiiiii

[verse 1 - Cityscape Rhymes]
In the shadows, where the city breathes  
Lights flicker, tales untold, dreams weave  
Raps echo, through the concrete veins  
Chasing visions in the pouring rain  
zzzzzz

[Chorus - Urban Anthem]
Rhapsody, we rise and roar  
Boss of beats, we crave for more  
oooooo  
iiiiiiii

[verse 2 - Grit and Glow]
Marching forward, with a steady flow  
Streetlights dancing, as the city glows  
Power in the words, like a tidal wave  
In this urban jungle, we are brave  
ahhhhhh

[Bridge - Dreamer's Call]
Voices blend, in the urban sprawl  
Rhapsody echoes, through the chaos call  
shhhhhhhh

[outro - Rhapsody Boss]
Vibrant beats, in the city's heart  
From the shadows, a brand new start  
oooooo
