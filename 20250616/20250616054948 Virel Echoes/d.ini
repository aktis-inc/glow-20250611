wwwwww oooooo  

[Verse 1 - Nature's Lilt]  
Branches whisper tales untold  
Fields embrace the stories old  
ooo iiiiiiiiiii  
The breeze carries dreams anew  

[Chorus - Harmonious Echoes]  
laaaaaa iiiii  
In the heart of the land, we find  
Melodies of the soul unwind  
ooooo zzzzzzz  

[Bridge - Reflective Moments]  
Leaves rustle with secrets deep  
Each step echoes what we keep  
ahhhh oooooo  

[Verse 2 - Timeless Journey]  
Rivers carve paths through the time  
Songs of past in rhythm and rhyme  
iiiiii iiiii ooooo  

[Outro - Fading Light]  
As the sun sets, dreams take flight  
In the echoes of the night  
wwwwww zzzzzzz
