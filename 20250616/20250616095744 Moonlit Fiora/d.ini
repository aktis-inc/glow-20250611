lyrics = [intro - Moonlit Reflections]
ooooooo

[verse - Night's Embrace]
Beneath the silver glow
Whispers of the sea unfold
Gentle touch of the breeze
Carrying dreams untold

[chorus - Celestial Dance]
Softly, softly, the night speaks
Fiora sighs, moonlight streaks
A melody that gently weaves
Through the quiet, peaceful leaves

[bridge - Whispered Echoes]
Under stars, secrets flow
In the shadows, hearts will grow
Serenades of the night sky
In Fiora, dreams never die

[outro - Tranquil Fade]
aaaaa oooooo iiiiiii
Night fades, dreams remain
Echoes of the moon's refrain
