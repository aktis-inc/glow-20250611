lyrics = [intro - Rhythmic Sunrise]

[verse 1 - Echoes of Tradition]
Tala, rhythms call beneath the sky  
Guitars sing, in harmony we fly  
oooooo aaaahhh

[Pre-Chorus - Vibe of the Land]
[soft drums]  
Ancient voices rise and fall,  
Colors blend in a dreamlike sprawl  

[Chorus - Dance of the Sun]
Tala echoes through the night  
Feel the warmth, the world alight  
wooooo ahhhh

[Verse 2 - Harmony's Journey]
Guitar strings whisper tales untold  
In our dance, the stories unfold  
iiiiiiiii ooooo

[Bridge - Cultural Flow]
Heartbeat syncs with the earth's embrace  
Hands clap, we move, find our place  
[echoed chants]

[outro - Tala's Embrace]
[fade out]  
oooooo iiiiii
