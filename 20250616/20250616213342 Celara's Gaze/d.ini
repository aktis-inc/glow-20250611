[verse 1 – Celara's Vision]
Colors burst in the sun's embrace
Rhythms dance on the sands

[Chorus – Echoing Sands]

iiiiiii

[Bridge - Heritage Beat]
Tradition sings through the breeze
Hearts align with ancient pulse

[verse 2]
Echoes of a timeless dance
Stories told in every note

[outro - Celara's Gaze]
