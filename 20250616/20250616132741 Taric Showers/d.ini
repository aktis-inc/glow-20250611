lyrics = [intro - Gentle Rain]

[verse - Memories Unfold]
Tales of yesterday drip down the glass
In the rain's embrace, time seems to pass
ooooo 
iiiii

[chorus - Heartfelt Echo]
In Taric Showers, dreams find their way
Through every drop, the past will sway
ooooooooo

[bridge - Raindrop Dance]
Each note a drop, a gentle dance
Lost in the rhythm of chance
ahhhhh 
ssssss

[outro - Fading Rain]
Whispers linger, then drift away
In the showers of a forgotten day
