oooooo  
iiiiiiii

[verse - Festival Dawn]  
Colors burst, rhythm flows (oooo)  
In the heart, where stories grow  
Jivana sings, with the wind's embrace  
A melody that time can't erase

[Chorus - Spirited Dance]  
Ahhhhhh  
Dance with the sun, under moonlit skies  
oooooo  
Joy in every step, where the spirit flies

[Bridge - Harmonic Echo]  
Sitar whispers, tales of old  
Harmonies that never grow cold  
Rhythms weave, stories unfold  
Ahhhhhh  
iiiiiiii

[outro - Sunset Glow]  
Jivana's melody, echoes in the night  
oooooo  
With every note, the world shines bright
