lyrics = [intro]
oooo  
[market hum]  

[verse 1]  
Colors weave through the air  
Voices blend, laughter shared  
Steps align in rhythmic flow  
We dance where the spices grow  

[Pre-Chorus]  
With every sound, a story sings  
In the bazaar’s embrace, joy it brings  

[Chorus]  
oooo  
Bazaar beats, hearts in sync  
Dancing lights, melodies wink  

[Bridge]  
Traditions meet the new  
Echoes of time, vibrant and true  
iiiiiiiiii  

[verse 2]  
Stalls alive with sights and sounds  
In this dance, no bounds  
Energy of the past and present  
In every moment, a gift sent  

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[outro]  
As the sun dips low  
In the bazaar, we glow  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii
