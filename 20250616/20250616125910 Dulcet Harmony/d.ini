lyrics = [intro - Warm Glow]
(soft hum) aaaa ooooo  
[verse 1 - Velvet Echo]  
Dance in the rhythm, where memories flow  
Feel the heartbeat, in lights we glow  
[Chorus - Dulcet Harmony]  
ooooo  
You and I, in a timeless song  
Harmony, where we belong  
[Bridge - Golden Days]  
ooooo ahhhh  
Together we sway, in echoes of gold  
Laughter and love, stories unfold  
[verse 2 - Whispered Dreams]  
In a moment, past and present meet  
Step by step, our hearts in beat  
[Outro - Fading Light]  
iiiiii aaaah  
As the music fades, the feeling stays  
In dulcet dreams, we find our ways
