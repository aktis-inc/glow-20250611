[verse 1 – Javor's Call]
In the dawn, whispers blend
Leaves dance with the morning light

Soft steps on ancient paths

Nature's song, heart's embrace

Voice of the winds
Guiding through timeless dreams

Stories unfold, in the breeze
Each note a tale of old
iiii ooooo

ooooo
Echoes fade into the trees
Serenity in every breath]
