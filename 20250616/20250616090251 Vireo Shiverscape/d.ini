oooooo iiiiiiii

[verse 1 - Neon Glow]  
Lights flicker, shadows sway  
In this heartbeat, we play  
Whispers echo through the night  
Dreams take flight, in this light  
oooooo iiiiiiii

[Pre-Chorus - Electric Spark]  
ooooo  
Feel it rising, through the air  
Every touch, everywhere  
ooooo

[Chorus - Vireo's Rhythm]  
wooooo  
Dance with me, in this dream  
Every moment, a gleam  

[Bridge - Twilight Echo]  
Steps on pavement, heartbeats race  
In this city, find our place  
Ahhh iiiiiii

[verse 2 - Starlit Path]  
Underneath the shining sky  
We let go, no need to try  
Dancing through the city's heart  
Never want to be apart

[outro - Shiverscape Fade]  
ooooo wooooo  
In this rhythm, we reside  
Together, side by side  
iiiiiiiiiiii
