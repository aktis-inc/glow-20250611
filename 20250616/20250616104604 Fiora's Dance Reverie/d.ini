aaaaa oooooo
Colors swirl, feet move
Tradition whispers in rhythm
Dance, where night meets soul

iiiiiiiyaaa
Fiora's dance, a story told
Vibrant heart, bold and gold

Echoes of joy in the night
Euphoria, in every beat

Dance, let the music lead
Fiora's call, we all heed

oooooo
Celebration, in every breath
Dance, until there's nothing left
