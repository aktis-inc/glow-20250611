lyrics = [intro rhythm]

[verse 1 – Echoes of Tradition]
Through the timeless sands, stories unfold
Voices harmonize, tales of the old
oooooooo

[Chorus – Dance of Unity]  
iiiiii  
Hearts beat as one beneath the sun  
Embrace the rhythm, let it run

[Bridge – Flow of Spirit] 
Waves of sound, a gentle embrace  
Unity found, in this sacred space  
ahhhhhh

[verse 2]
Colors blend in a vibrant stream  
Life and love, a shared dream  
whispered echoes

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[outro - Waver of Harmony]
