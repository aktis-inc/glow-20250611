(Instrumental) iiiiiii oo aaa
[verse 1 - Ancient Bonds]
Across the sands, whispers of past
In every grain, stories amassed
oooooo aaa iiiii
[Pre-Chorus - Heartstrings]  
Emotions flow, like river's path
In echoes, we find aftermath
[Chorus - Marah's Echoes]  
oooooo  
iiiiiiiiiyaaaa
[Bridge - Timeless Ties] 
Unseen threads, weaving our fate
Through time's dance, hearts resonate
[verse 2 - Unbroken Ties]
In the night, stars softly hum
Binding us, the beat of a drum
[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  
[outro - Fade to Stars]
