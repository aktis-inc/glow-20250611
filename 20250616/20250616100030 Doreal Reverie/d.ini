lyrics = [intro - nostalgic whispers]

[musical interlude]

[verse 1 - Heart's Lament]
In shadows of yesteryears
Echoes of love linger on
Tales told in whispers
Beneath the moon's soft glow

[chorus - Eternal Embrace]
ahhhhh oooooo
In dreams, we meet again
Time's gentle touch
A dance of hearts, unbroken

[verse 2 - Velvet Memories]
Starlit paths we wander
Songs of old, a soft refrain
Moments like jewels
Held close to the heart

[bridge - Timeless Echo]
Through the ages, love's refrain
A melody never fades
ahhhhhhhh

[outro - Doreal Reverie]
In the quiet of the night
A serenade of souls, forever
