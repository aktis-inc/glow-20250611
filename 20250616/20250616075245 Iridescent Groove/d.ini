lyrics = [intro - shimmering echoes]
(synthesized voice) Light whispers, rhythm calls  
(synthesized voice) Across the sky, colors fall  
iiiiiiiiiiii  
oooooooooo

[verse 1 – Silk Patterns]  
In the dance of shadows, we find  
The melody of heart's design  
Sitar sings, tabla beats align  
ooooo iiiiii

[Pre-Chorus – Radiant Flow]  
[soft instrumental]  
ooooo  
Across the horizon, we glide  
Each note a step, side by side

[Chorus – Iridescent Groove]  
woooooo  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Harmony Shift]  
Tradition's echo, future's song (let's go!)  
In this groove, we all belong (alright!)  
aaaaahhhh mmmmmm  
[echoed harmony]

[verse 2]  
Vibrant strings, a timeless thread  
We weave the stories, never unsaid  
In rhythm's pulse, we're all led

[outro - Fading Glow]  
[soft fade]  
sssshhhhh oooooo  
[gentle end]
