lyrics = [intro serenity]

[gentle chant]  
ooooo  
aaaaa  

[verse]  
Whispers of the divine  
In the heart's temple  
Sway with the breeze  
Soft echoes of time  

[chorus]  
Aurela calls  
In sacred harmony  
Ethereal peace  
In every breath  

[bridge - Tranquility]  
Flow like a river  
In the sacred grove  
Calm in the essence  
Of eternal love  

[outro - Peaceful Respite]  
wooo  
shhhh  
Aurela‚Ä¶  
ooooo
