(whispering echoes)  
Feel the spark in the air  
ooooo  

[verse 1 – Urban Pulse]  
Streets alive, glowing bright  
Echoes call in the night  
oooo  

[Pre-Chorus – Twilight Rise]  
Electric heartbeats  
Ignite the skies  
ooooo  
ooooo  

[Chorus – Zephyr Blaze]  
Fly high, through the fire  
Ride the wave, higher and higher  
aaaaaa  
aaaaaa  

[Bridge - Neon Drift]  
In the rush, we find our way  
Lost in color, night to day  
shhhhhh  
ooooooo  

[verse 2 – Skyline Dreams]  
City breathes, dreams unfold  
In the light, stories told  
oooooo  

[glitch build-up]  
oooooo  
oooooo  

[outro - Sunset Echoes]  
ooooo  
Illuminated silence  
Fading into whispers  
ooooo]
