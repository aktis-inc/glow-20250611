[verse 1 - Mystic Dawn]  
(sitar echoes)  
In the heart of the city, rhythms pulse  
Strings weave tales of dreams  
sssshhhh ooo

[chorus - Radiant Pulse]  
Dance through time, vibrant hues  
Melody whispers, ancient tunes

[bridge - Cultural Mosaic]  
Traditions unfold, a new story told  
Voices blend, harmonies bold  
aaaaa iiiii

[verse 2 - Urban Serenade]  
City lights and ancient sights  
Echoes of past, future ignites  
zzzzhhhhh

[outro - Glare of Melodies]  
Journey through soundscapes, entwined  
The Glare leads, where worlds combine  
oooooo iiiii]
