shshshshhh

[verse 1 – Urban Sunrise]  
Guitar strings hum, city comes alive  
Voices blend in harmony, rhythm of the streets  
ooooooohhh

[Chorus – Sunset Groove]  
Feel the pulse, feel the beat  
Sky ablaze, dance with me  
iiiiiiiiiiii

[Bridge - Twilight Echo]  
Neon lights guide our way  
In the city, we sway  
ahhhhhh

[verse 2 – Nightfall Beat]  
Bassline carries us through  
Whispers of the night, vibrant and true  
oooooo

[outro - Boreal Groove]  
Dance into the night, under the stars  
Together, we are free  
shshshshhh]
