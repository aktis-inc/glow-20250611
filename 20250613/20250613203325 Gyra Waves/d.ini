[verse 1 – City Lights]
whispers echo through the night  
neon dreams in soft twilight  
oooooo iiiiiiiii  

[build-up – Skyline]
gentle waves of sound arise  
rhythms pulse like city sighs  
mmmmmmm ahhhhhh  

[chorus – Gyra Waves]
wooooooo  
lost in the flow, we go  
beyond the glow, we know  

[bridge – Twilight Drift]
patterns dance in endless skies  
reflections of our lullabies  
shhhhhhh ooooo  

[outro – Fading Light]
oooooo  
drifting on gyra waves  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
