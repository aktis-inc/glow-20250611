[verse 1]
Caden's breath, like whispered winds
Across the silent, golden sands
ooooo iiiii

[Chorus - Nature's Embrace]  
Breathe with the trees, the earth's own sigh
Inhale the stars, let the moment fly
ahhhhhhhhhh

[Bridge - Whispering Echo]  
Silent streams and endless dreams
Caden's voice in moonlit beams
shhhh iiiii

[outro - Fade to Light]
Caden's whisper, a gentle flight
Through the dusk, into the night
oooooo iiiii
