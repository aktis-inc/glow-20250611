lyrics = [intro - rising tension]
(Spoken word) The path is not for the faint of heart  
ooooooo  
Rise, and face the storm

[verse 1 – Grit and Grind]  
Relentless will, like fire burns  
Strength found in each scar earned  
Keep moving forward, never slow  
Feel the power start to grow  
aaaaa

[Pre-Chorus – Unyielding Spirit]  
Through the night, we blaze a trail  
Echoes of a past that won't derail  
iiiiiiiiiiii

[Chorus – Haven Mindset]  
Stand with courage, hearts ignite  
oooooo  
In this haven, find your light  
woooooo

[Bridge - Resilient Core]  
Each heartbeat a drum of war  
Determination at the core  
ahhhhh  
shhhhhh

[verse 2]  
Mountains high, valleys deep  
Dreams awaken from their sleep  
In the face of doubt, I rise  
Unleash the fire in my eyes  
ooooo

[outro - relentless echo]  
(Spoken word) Embrace the struggle, it builds you stronger  
oooo  
Feel the haven in your soul
