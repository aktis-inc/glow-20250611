ooooo

[verse 1 – Starlit Dance]
Underneath the lantern glow
Hearts entwined in gentle flow
iiiiii

[Pre-Chorus – Enchanted Echo]
oooooo
Dreams whisper in the night
Kisses carried on the breeze

[Chorus – Wynter's Melody]
wooooo  
iiiiii

[Bridge – Timeless Waltz]
Holding time in our embrace
Every step a fleeting trace
ahhhhhh

[outro – Fading Light]
ooooo  
As the stars bid us goodbye
Our melody will never die
