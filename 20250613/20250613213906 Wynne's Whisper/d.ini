[verse 1]  
Soft echoes at dawn's embrace  
Gentle whispers through the mist  
oooo aaaaaa

[chorus]  
iiiiii  
Nature's song in harmony  
Every breath a new beginning

[bridge]  
Flowing streams and rustling leaves  
In the calm, we find our peace  
ohhhhh uuuuu

[outro]  
whispering winds, gentle harmonies  
fade into the morning light
