lyrics = [intro - gentle breeze]

[verse]

Whispers in the wind,  
dreams woven in time,  
echoes of yesteryear,  
softly they chime.

[chorus - serene flow]

ooooo  
iiiii  
ahhhh

[bridge - tranquil drift]

Gentle waves of thought,  
carried on a sigh,  
moments of clarity,  
beneath the vast sky.

[outro - fading light]
