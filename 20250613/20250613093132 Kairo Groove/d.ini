oooo  
oooo

[verse 1 – City Lights]  
In the rush of electric dreams,  
Kairo sings in the glow,  
Dancing shadows on the streets,  
Feel the rhythm flow.  
iiiiiiii

[Chorus – Groove Beat]  
Let the night take you higher,  
Kairo groove, burning fire,  
oooooo  
Dance in the heart of desire.

[Bridge - Urban Echo]  
oooooo  
Feel the pulse, feel the vibe,  
In the city, we're alive.  
oooooo

[verse 2]  
Lost in colors, lost in sound,  
Kairo's magic all around.  
In the night, we come alive,  
In the beat, we thrive.

[outro - Dusk Dance]  
oooo  
oooo  
Fade into the night, Kairo's light.
