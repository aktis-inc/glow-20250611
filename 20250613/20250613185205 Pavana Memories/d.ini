lyrics = [intro - soft dawn]

[verse 1 - Fading Echoes]
Memory threads, weave through time  
Gentle whispers, in the night

[chorus - Heart's Whisper]
ooooo
iiiiii  
Silent echoes, past and present  
Tides of time, softly blend

[verse 2 - Gentle Breeze]
Footprints fade, in the sand  
Stories told, by the wind

[bridge - Reminiscence]
Ahhhh oooo  
Moments gone, yet they linger  
In the heart, forevermore

[outro - Dusk's Embrace]
oooooo  
iiiiii  
Past and future, hand in hand  
In the glow, of night's embrace
