lyrics = [intro - celestial pulse]
(Playful voice) In the light of distant stars
(Playful voice) Where rhythms collide, we find

[verse 1 – Starry Embrace]
Dance with me in cosmic waves
Colors blend, we lose our way
oooooo iiiiiiiiiii
Our steps, a dance of light

[Pre-Chorus – Galactic Flow]
Feel the pulse, the stars align
In this space, we intertwine

[Chorus – Jovian Rhythm]
wooooooo  
iiiiiii iiiiiiii  
Dance on the edge, where echoes play

[Bridge - Ethereal Drift] 
We are the night, we are the dream 
Together, we create the stream
ooooooo shhhhh

[verse 2]
In this dance, we find our home
Across the skies, we freely roam
Our heartbeat syncs with time

[outro - Jovian Groove]
oooooo  
iiiiiiii  
Dance through the stars, where echoes fade
[fade out]
