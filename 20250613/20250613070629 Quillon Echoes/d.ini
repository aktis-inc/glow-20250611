lyrics = [intro - gentle dawn]

[verse 1 - Whispers of Time]
Gentle waves of memory
Soft as the morning light
In the heart's quiet gallery
Love's song takes flight
ooooo

[pre-chorus - Echoed Dreams]
iiiiiiii
Between the shadows and the gleam
Every note a vivid dream

[chorus - Quillon's Embrace]
ahhhhhh
In the echo of this space
Love's tender, timeless grace
ooooo

[bridge - Serenade of Stars]
Underneath the starlit sky
Whispers weave a lullaby
Every echo, a heart's sigh

[outro - Fading Glow]
shhhhhhhh
As the city lights dim low
In love's warmth, we softly glow
