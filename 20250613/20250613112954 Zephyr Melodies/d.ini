oooooo  
iiiiii  

[verse 1 - Timeless Love]  
In the night, your eyes shine  
Memories dance, in gentle rhyme  
zzzzzzhhhhhh  

[Pre-Chorus - Heartbeat Echo]

Our love, a story untold  
In the breeze, whispers unfold  

[Chorus - Eternal Embrace]

[Bridge - Dreamscape]  
Beneath the stars, we find our way  
Hearts in sync, where dreams lay  
Ahhhhhh shhhhhh  
[echoed sigh]

Moonlit paths, our secret place  
Timeless bonds, hearts interlace  
ssssshhhh oooo

[soft duet harmony]  
Our love, forever in the night  
Silent echoes, our hearts' light]
