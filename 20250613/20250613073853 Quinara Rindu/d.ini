Soft whispers of dawn
oooooo aaaaa

[verse 1]
Mimpi datang di malam
Berbisik nada rindu
Jiwa melayang jauh
Dalam dekapan bayu
iiiiiiii

[chorus]
Quinara rindu dalam jiwa
ooooo
Mengalir lembut, menyapa

[bridge]
Langit biru menari
Dengan bintang berseri
oooo aaaa

[outro]
Rindu tetap membara
Di setiap hembusan nafas
oooooo
