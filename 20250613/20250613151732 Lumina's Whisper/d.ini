(Soft echo) iiillllluminaaaa  
(Soft echo) iiiiiiii  

[verse 1 - Whispered Journey]  
Through the veil of silence, a path unfolds  
Gentle echoes carry stories untold  
oooooo  

[Pre-Chorus - Harmonic Drift]  
(Whisper) Luminous whispers in the night  
Guiding light, gentle and bright  
iiiiiiii

[Chorus - Celestial Embrace]  
wooooooo  
Embrace the silence, feel the rise  
In the glow of the endless skies  
ahhhhhhhh

[Bridge - Ethereal Pulse]  
Floating through realms unknown  
Guided by the celestial tone  
ahhhh iiiiiiii

[verse 2 - Serene Passage]  
Calm waves in the ocean of dreams  
Flowing through life's gentle streams  
ohhhhhh iiiiii

[outro - Lumina's Whisper]  
(Soft echo) iiiillllluminaaaa
