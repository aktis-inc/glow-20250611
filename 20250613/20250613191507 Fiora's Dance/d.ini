oooooo aaaaa  
[verse 1 – Street Pulse]  
Colors merge in the dance  
Tradition whispers to the beat  
Echoes of the past, alive  
iiiiii ooooo  

[Chorus – Fiora's Call]  
Fiora brings the night alive  
Dance of worlds, vibrant and wild  
oooooo oo-ooo  

[Bridge - Fusion Flow]  
Old and new in harmony  
Steps that tell a story  
Rhythms blend, heartbeats align  

[verse 2 – Cultural Beat]  
Hands clap, the crowd moves  
Energy surges through the air  
A symphony of time  

[Outro – Dance Unites]  
Fiora's dance, a timeless grace  
In every step, the world embraces  
aaaaa iiiiiii]
