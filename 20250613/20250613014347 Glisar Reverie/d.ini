lyrics = [intro - Glisar Echo]

[verse - Whispering Pines]
In the silence of the hills,
Where dreams craft their tales,
Glimmers of the unseen,
Flow like whispers in the breeze.
ooohhh

[Pre-Chorus - Ethereal Flow]
Murmurs of the ancient stars,
Guiding paths with their light,
In melodies that weave,
Through the tapestry of night.

[Chorus - Celestial Dance]
oooo  
Glisar, in your reverie,
iiii  
The world sings in harmony,
In your embrace, we find,
A dance of souls, unconfined.

[Bridge - Mystic River]
Gliding through the veils of mist,
Where time stands still and true,
Each note a gentle kiss,
From the universe to you.

[Chorus - Celestial Dance]
oooo  
Glisar, in your reverie,
iiii  
The world sings in harmony,
In your embrace, we find,
A dance of souls, unconfined.

[outro - Echoing Whisper]
Softly fades the light,
In the glisar night,
ooohhh  
Dreams take flight,
In the tranquil night.
