(street sounds) oooo

[verse 1 – Urban Echoes]  
In the shadows, dreams awake  
Neon whispers, stories break  
iiiiiiiiii  

[Chorus – Visionary]  
wooooo  
Eyes wide, in the city glow  
ooooo  

[Bridge - Midnight Drive]  
Cruising through the night, tales untold  
Future's written in the bold  

[verse 2]  
Concrete jungle, rhythm flows  
Every heartbeat, the city knows  
zzzzzzhhhhhh  

[outro - Nyra Vision]  
(echoing footsteps)  
Dreams never fade, they evolve  
In the city's heartbeat, we resolve  
ooooooo
