[verse]
In the shadow of the storm  
I find echoes of my own  
Whispers lost to the wind  
Silent cries in the night

[Pre-Chorus – Rising Tide]
oooooo  
Feel the waves crash below  
As the sky begins to weep  

[Chorus – Echo's Call]
wooooo  
iiiiiii  
Holding on to a fleeting breath  
Amidst the roar of the sea  

[Bridge - Tempest's Heart]
Lost in the echoes  
Where silence screams  
I stand alone  
In the eye of dreams

[outro - Brume's Last Echo]
oooooo  
iiiiiii  
The night whispers my name  
As I fade into the dawn
