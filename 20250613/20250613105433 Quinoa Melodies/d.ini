[verse]

Notes of gold, timeless air  
In rhythm's arms, we sway  
Echoes of past, yet ahead  
In melodies, we find our way  

[chorus]

aaaaaa oooooo  
Hearts beat as one, in tune  
Through cultures' dance, we bloom  
oooooo iiiiii  

[bridge - Ethereal Harmony]

Soft whispers of the flute  
Tabla's call in the distance  
iiiiii  
In this fusion, we unite

[verse 2]

Threads of sound, woven tight  
Past and future, in delight  
Harmony in every note  
Together, we float

[outro - Quinoa Melodies]

woooooo  
iiiiiiiii  
Eternal echoes, vibrant skies
