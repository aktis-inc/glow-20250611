[verse 1 – Rising Power]
In the neon glow, I walk the line
Rhythm hits, I'm feeling fine
oooooo  
iiiiiiii

[Chorus – Command & Flow]
Halon steps into the light
Power in the night, taking flight
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[Bridge – Urban Pulse]
City's breath, heartbeat strong
In this groove, where I belong
sssshhhhh  
ooooooo

[verse 2]
Lights flash, I own the scene
Beneath the stars, I'm the dream
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Chorus – Command & Flow]
Halon moves, can't be tamed
In this rhythm, I'll be named

[outro - Groove's End]
Power fades, but I'm still here
Echoes linger, loud and clear]
