lyrics = [intro - serene chimes]

[verse 1 - Flowing Harmony]
Gentle breeze, whispers in the air  
Rivers carry tunes of forgotten lore  
hhhhhh

[chorus - Ethereal Echo]
oooooo  
Voices merge with the gentle flow  
Soulful hymns, where spirits grow  
oooooo  

[bridge - Mystic Dance]
Dance of the leaves, a timeless trance  
Echoing the past, in a sacred dance  
ssssss

[verse 2 - Whispering Winds]
Nature's call, in every sound  
Harmony in roots and ground  
oooooo

[outro - Serein Symphony]
Soft echoes fade, as dusk descends  
In serene symphony, the journey ends  
iiiiii]
