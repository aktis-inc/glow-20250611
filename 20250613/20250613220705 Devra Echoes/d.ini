[verse 1 - Mountain Whispers]
The hills hold tales untold
In shadows, secrets unfold
oooooo

[chorus - Echoes of Devra]
iiiiiiii
Voices rise with the dawn
Songs of old never gone

[bridge - Sarangi's Cry]
Strings weep, heartbeats align
Time's river, stories entwine
ahhhhhhh

[verse 2 - Terraced Dreams]
Fields whisper in the breeze
Echoes dance among the trees
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[outro - Fading Mist]
ooooo
Memories linger, soft and kind
In Devra's echoes, peace we find
