[verse]

Soft whispers of dawn
Flowing through the mist
Hearts awaken gently

[bridge]

oooooh

[chorus - dawn echoes]

In the silence, echoes remain
A melody of past and future
iiiiiiiii

[verse 2]

Time dances lightly
On the strings of memory
Harmony of the soul

[outro - fading light]

shhhhhhh oooooo

[gentle fade]
