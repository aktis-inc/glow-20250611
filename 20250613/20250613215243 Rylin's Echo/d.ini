[verse 1 - Vibe Unfolds]  
Voices rise, in harmony we sway  
Drums call, the heart of the city  
Rylin's echo, in every step we take  
A vibrant dance, through night and day  
oooo

[Chorus - Soul's Pulse]  
Feel the beat, let it guide your soul  
Rylin's heart, where stories unfold  
Aaaaaa

[Bridge - Harmony's Embrace]  
Brass sings, beneath the moonlit sky  
Voices weave, a tapestry of sound  
Energy flows, like rivers to the sea  

[outro - Celebration's End]  
Echos linger, as night turns to day  
In Rylin's echo, we find our way  
Aaaaa oooo
