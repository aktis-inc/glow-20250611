[street whispers] oooo

[verse 1 - Urban Pulse]
Kairo streets beat in time
Echoes rise, rhythm and rhyme
Life in neon, bold and bright
City dreams come alive at night

[hook]
woooooo  
Echoes fly high aaaa

[verse 2 - Concrete Symphony]
Voices blend in crowded lanes
Stories told, breaking chains
Rap flows like river streams
Urban heart, chasing dreams

[outro]
Kairo echoes fade, yet linger on iiiaaahhhh
