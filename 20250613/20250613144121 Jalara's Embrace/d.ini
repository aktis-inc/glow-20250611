lyrics = [intro - soft echoes]

[verse 1 – Timeless Whispers]
In the moonlit glow, shadows sway
Notes of old, they gently play

[Chorus – Echoes of the Past]
ooooo  
iiiiiiiiii
Embrace the moment, let it linger
Melodies weave through time, a gentle whisper

[Bridge - Harmonious Dream]
In your eyes, a world unfolds  
Stories of love, eternally told  
ahhhhhh

[verse 2]
Beneath the stars, we find our way
Through memories, in dreams we stay

[outro - Jalara's Embrace]
Softly fading, the echoes remain
A timeless song, through heart and vein
