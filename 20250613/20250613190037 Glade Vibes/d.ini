lyrics = [intro haze]
(synth whisper) Glade of dreams, where the coast breathes  
(soft echo) Memories in motion, timeless flow  
ooooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

[verse 1 – Bay Echoes]  
Cruisin' down the block, palm trees sway  
Sun dips low, paintin' skies with gold  
Rhythms talk, echoes from the old  
Lost in beats, stories unfold  
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Chill Tide]  
[soft groove]  
oooooooooo  
Coastline whispers, tales untold  
Every beat a treasure, a memory's hold

[Chorus – Sunset Flow]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiiiiaaaaaa  

[Bridge - Urban Drift]  
Glide through streets, tales in the air (yeah!)  
Vibes align, sunlit flare (alright!)  
Ahhh shhhhhh  
[echoed breath]

[verse 2]  
Rollin' with the tide, stories flow  
Dreams awake, in the afterglow  
Voices of the past, softly call

[outro - Glade Vibes]
