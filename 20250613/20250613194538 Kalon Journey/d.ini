lyrics = [intro - Skyline Glow]
wooooooo  
The city's pulse beneath our feet  
oooooo

[verse 1 - Steps of Light]  
We walk through dreams, the night ignites  
Every corner holds a whisper, unseen  

[Pre-Chorus - Rising Beat]  
Catch the rhythm, hearts align  
iiiiiiiii  
Feel the echoes, intertwine  

[Chorus - Kalon Journey]  
oooooo  
On our way, we find the light  
Through the night, we take the flight  

[Bridge - Electric Horizon]  
A journey of colors, in the sound  
Steps blend with beats, profound  

[verse 2]  
Paths we've never known, unfold  
Stories in the air, untold  

[Final Chorus - Infinite Flight]  
wooooooo  
Kalon journey, feel the stride  
Across the stars, we glide  

[outro - Fade to Dawn]  
The journey ends, but echoes last  
oooooo  
With every beat, the past
