Veil of memories, swaying with time
Rhythm of heartbeats, timeless and warm

Melodies weave through the night
Dance in the glow of moonlight

[verse 2 - Whispered Dreams]
Stars above, witness our tale
Notes that linger, like a gentle gale

Harmony of past and present collide
In the embrace of sound, we glide
ahh ahh

Dreams unfold, in a vibrant tapestry
A symphony of the heart, forever free
