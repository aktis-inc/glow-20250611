wooooooo

[verse 1 - Silent Cries]
In the silence, shadows call
Through the mist, memories fffffall
Haaaaa

[Chorus - Harmis Echo]
Echoes whisper, sorrow's flight
Carried on the wings of night
oooooo

[Bridge - Forgotten Dreams]
Dreams like phantoms, hidden deep
Silent voices, secrets keep
shhhhh

[outro - Fading Light]
In the fading light, we roam
Seeking echoes, far from home
ahhhhhhh]
