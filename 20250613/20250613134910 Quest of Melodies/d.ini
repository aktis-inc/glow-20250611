[verse 1 – Joyous Echoes]
Colors burst in the night
Songs of old, tales untold
Dance with the wind, feel the light
iiiiiii aaaa ooooo

[Pre-Chorus – Vibrant Pulse]  
[drum build-up]
Clap your hands, join the dance
Every step, a story of chance

[Chorus – Celebration Surge]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii aaaaa

[Bridge - Melodic Flow] 
In the rhythm, we find our way (hey!)
Melodies that never fade (ok!)
ahhhhhh ooooooo  
[echoed cheers]

[verse 2]
Traditions weave through time
Harmony in every rhyme
Feel the beat, let it guide

[outro - Quest of Melodies]
