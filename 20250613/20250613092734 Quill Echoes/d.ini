lyrics = [intro - soft rain]

[verse]

(whispered voice) silent echoes, in the night
(whispered voice) memories, like rain on glass
ooooo  
iiiiiiii

[verse 1 â€“ Melancholy Whispers]
In shadows, stories unfold
Tales of yesterdays, untold
Softly, the heartbeats call
To moments lost, in the fall
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[soft chorus]
wooooooo  
iiiii

[outro - fading whispers]
(whispered voice) echoes fade, in the mist
(whispered voice) dreams remain, in the quiet
