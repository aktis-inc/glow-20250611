[soft hum]
ooooooo
iiiiiiii

[verse 1 – Whispered Winds]
The sands carry tales untold
In the silence, whispers unfold
A journey through time's embrace

[Chorus – Horizon's Glow]
ooohhh
eeeeee
Across the dunes, echoes call

[Bridge – Desert's Heart]
Softly, the past and present blend
In the warmth, all paths mend
ahhhh shhhhh

[outro]
iiiiiii
ooooooo
