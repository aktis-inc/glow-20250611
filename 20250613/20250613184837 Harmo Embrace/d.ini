[vocal intro]
ooooo

[verse 1 – Moonlit Serenade]
In the sands, we weave our tales
Echoes of ancients in our veins
Harmo calls in whispered tones

[chorus – Embrace in the Stars]
wooooo  
iiiiii

[instrumental interlude]
[oud and strings]

[verse 2 – Timeless Echo]
Through the dunes, our hearts align
Every step a dance divine
Harmo's song, forever shines

[bridge – Enchanted Rhythm]
Aaaaaaaa
In the night, we find our place
Embrace beneath the starry gaze

[chorus – Embrace in the Stars]
wooooo  
iiiiii

[outro - Harmo's Lullaby]
Silent sands, cradle dreams
In Harmo's arms, forever gleam
