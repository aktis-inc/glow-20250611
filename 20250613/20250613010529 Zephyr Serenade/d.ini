(Flute interlude)
oooooo

[verse 1 – Whispering Zephyr]
Gentle breeze carries tales untold
Through the night, dreams unfold
iiiiiiii

[Chorus – Celestial Harmony]
Soft echoes, stars align
Melodies in moonlit shrine
aaaaaa

[Bridge - Ethereal Dance]
Dance of shadows, light's embrace
In this moment, time's efface
wooooooo

[verse 2 – Luminous Path]
Path of light, through sky and stream
Weaving dreams, in gentle theme
zzzzzzhhhhh

[outro - Twilight Glow]
(Flute echoes)
Serenity's call
oooooo
