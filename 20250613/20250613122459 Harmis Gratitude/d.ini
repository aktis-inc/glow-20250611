lyrics = [Intro - Sunrise Harmony]
(Soft vocals) The light of dawn unfolds  
Gentle warmth, whispers of thanks  
ooooooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

[Verse 1 – Heartfelt Echo]  
In every breath, a blessing  
In every moment shared  
Gratitude like morning dew  
Love in every word  
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Gentle Refrain]  
[soft echoes]  
oooooooooo  
With you, my heart finds peace  
Every beat, a thank you song

[Chorus – Harmonic Embrace]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii  

[Bridge - Whispering Wind]  
I stand with open arms (embrace)  
In the glow of love's light (shine)  
Ahhhhhh shhhhhhh  
[echoed breath]

[Verse 2]  
Your wisdom guides my path  
Your love, a guiding star  
In gratitude, I find my strength

[glitch build-up]

[distorted whisper] love… gratitude… harmony… (oo-yeah!)
