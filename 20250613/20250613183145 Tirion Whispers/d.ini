lyrics = [intro]

[instrumental - lush strings]

[verse 1 - City Lights]
In the city’s embrace, whispers in the breeze
Stories untold, hearts intertwined

[chorus - Eternal Dance]
oooooooh  
Love's gentle sway, beneath the stars  
iiiiiiiiii

[verse 2 - Hidden Yearnings]
Eyes meet in silence, promises unspoken  
A dance of fate, in twilight’s glow

[bridge - Timeless Echo]
ahhhhhhh  
Time stands still, in this fleeting world  
zzzzzhhhh

[outro - Tirion Whispers]
oooooo  
Fading echoes of our secret song
