lyrics = [intro - Neon Pulse]
oooooo
city lights, glimmer bright
ooooo

[verse 1 - Urban Flow]
Streets alive, whispers glide
Echoed dreams, in the tide
ooooo
iiiiii

[Chorus - Gleam Dance]
Dance with shadows, in the glow
Rhythms guide, where hearts go
aaaaaa

[Bridge - City Lullaby]
Silent night, soft embrace
Midnight hum, gentle pace
ssssshhhh

[verse 2 - Vibrant Waves]
Colors blend, stories spin
In this place, we begin
oooooo

[outro - Gleam Groove]
Softly fades, night departs
Melodies linger, in our hearts]
