oooooo

[verse - Whispered Stars]
In the gentle night, hearts align  
Never knew the light could shine  
Llllaaaa

Tender dreams unfold beneath the sky  
Silent promises, never goodbye

[Chorus - Starlit Path]

Found a love, pure and true  
With every step, closer to you

Glimma's glow, in the night  
Guiding hearts, holding tight  
ahhhhhh

Soft echoes, fading slow  
In your arms, I find my glow
