[verse]

Sunrise over dunes, whispers in the wind  
Colors dance, ancient rhythms begin  
oooooo iiiiii

[chorus]

Braman calls, hearts align  
Echoes of time, a vibrant sign  
aaaa ooooo

[bridge]

Sarangi sings, dholak beats  
Harmony in dusty streets  
eeeeee ahhhh

[outro - fade with harmonium]
