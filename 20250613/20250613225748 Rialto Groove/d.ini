[verse 1]
Rising echoes in the streets  
Neon lights, where rhythm beats  
Rialto's call, a vibrant stream  
Dancing dreams, a seamless dream

[pre-chorus]
ooooo  
Laughter echoes, night unfolds  
Vibrant tales, as stories told

[chorus]
wooooooo  
Dance, dance, the night is bright  
With traditions, we unite  
iiiiiii

[bridge]
Brass and beats, a festive sway  
Celebrate the night away  
ahhhhhhh

[outro]
Rialto's groove, where worlds collide  
In this dance, joy cannot hide  
oooooo
