lyrics = [intro - gentle waves]

[verse 1]
Beneath the city lights, whispers call my name
Rhythms of the heart, in the night they play
oooo aaaa

[chorus]
Feel the magic, let it take control
iiiiii aaaaaa
Dance with shadows, where the dreams unfold

[bridge]
Lost in the echoes, of a distant drum
Souls united, as the night becomes one
ooooo

[verse 2]
In the silence, hear the stories told
Melodies linger, in the air so bold

[outro - fade]
oooo iiiiii
Jalira, carry me home
