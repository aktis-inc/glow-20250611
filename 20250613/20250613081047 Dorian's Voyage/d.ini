lyrics = [intro - Nautical Breeze]

[flute intro]

[verse - Setting Sail]
Under bright sails, tales unfold
Whispers of waves, stories told
Dancing masts, guiding light

[chorus - Ocean's Call]
oooooo
iiiiii
Sail with me, where dreams are free
Across the sea, to destiny

[verse - Journey's Heart]
Stars above, chart our course
With the wind, we find our force
In the night, dreams ignite

[Pre-Chorus - Whimsical Winds]
Playful tides, guide our ride
Into the blue, skies so wide

[Chorus - Ocean's Call]
woooooo
iiiiii  
Voyage on, with Dorian's song
Through the storm, we sail strong

[outro - Horizon's Embrace]
Carry on, where tales belong
With the sea, forever free  
[soft fade]
