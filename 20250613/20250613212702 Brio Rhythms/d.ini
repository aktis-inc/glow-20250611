[verse 1 – Fiesta Call]
Guitars strum with the sun's embrace
Footsteps echo in the street's warm face
ooooo  

[Pre-Chorus – Vibe Surge]
Clapping hands, hearts ignite
In this dance, we find our light

[Chorus – Brio Burst]
wooooooo  
Brio rhythms take us high
Feel the pulse, let spirits fly
iiiiiiiiii

[Bridge – Celebration Flow]
Colors swirl in joyous streams
Life's a dance, a dreamer's dream
ahhhhhhhh

[verse 2]
Trumpets sing, the night is young
In our hearts, a song unsung

[outro - Brio Rhythms]
[clapping fade]  
oooo eeee iiiiii
