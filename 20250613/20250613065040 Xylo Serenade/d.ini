[verse 1]
In the quiet of the night
Stars whisper tales untold
Hearts beating in silent flight
Dreams of love unfold

[chorus]
ooooo
Soft echoes in the breeze
Holding memories close
iiiiiiii

[bridge]
Through the mist of time
We find our way back home
oooooo aaaaaaa

[verse 2]
Every note a gentle touch
Strings of fate entwined
Melodies speak our truth
In the silence, we find

[outro - fading whispers]
