lyrics = [intro – Whispering Echoes]

[verse – Serenade of Dreams]
Softly flows the night  
Whispers of the past  
Gently, the heart sighs  
As dreams unfold

[chorus – Lumina's Call]  
oooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiii

[bridge – Ethereal Dance]  
In shadows, we wander  
Through echoes of time  
Silent vows linger  
In the moonlight's embrace

[outro – Fading Lumina]  
A serenade of whispers  
Soft as the night  
Beyond the horizon  
Dreams take flight
