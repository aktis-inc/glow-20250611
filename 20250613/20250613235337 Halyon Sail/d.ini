lyrics = [intro - Storm Surge]
Waves crash, horizon unseen
Thunder rolls, heartbeats quicken

[verse - The Call]
Rise with the dawn, onward we sail
The ocean's roar, our guiding tale
Echoes of valor, whispers of fate
Halyon's song, we navigate

[chorus - Sailor's Spirit]
Heave-ho, the winds will blow
iiiiii iiiiii oooooo
To the edge of the world, we go

[bridge - Tempest's Dance]
Lightning strikes, shadows play
Courage found in the fray
Shhhhhh ahhhhhh

[outro - Horizon's End]
The storm subsides, a new dawn gleams
Halyon's dream, beyond the streams
