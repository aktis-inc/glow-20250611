[verse - Morning Whisper]
oooooo  
Langit terbuka, sinar menari  
Di atas awan, jiwa melayang  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

[chorus - Horizon's Embrace]
oooooo  
Aruna mengalir, lembut dan abadi  
Melodi tenang, membawa damai  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

[verse - Tranquil Journey]
Seperti air mengalir, kita melayang  
Di bawah bintang, malam mendekap  
oooooo  

[bridge - Eternal Calm]
Angin berbisik, rahasia dibawa  
Dalam harmoni, dunia bernyanyi  
shhhhhhhhhh

[outro - Peaceful Fade]
oooooo  
Serenity finds us, in the gentle embrace  
Aruna's horizon, where dreams take flight
