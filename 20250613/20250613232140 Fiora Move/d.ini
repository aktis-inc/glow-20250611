[vocal layers]
Fiora moves with the night
Under stars, under lights
oooooooo oooooooo

[verse 1 – Neon Steps]
Through the city, feel the beat
Every corner, every street
Feel the rhythm, feel the heat

[Pre-Chorus – Electric Vibe]  
[soft echo]
dancing free, wild and bright
In the glow of city lights

[Chorus – Pulse of the City]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Street Serenade] 
Rhythm flows, life ignites (hey!)
In this dance, we unite (yeah!)
ahhhh oooooh

[verse 2]
Move like fire in the breeze
Feel the joy, feel the ease
In this moment, in this dream

[outro - Fiora Move]
