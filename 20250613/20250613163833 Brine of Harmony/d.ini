[silhouette voices]

The sun dips below, painting dreams
We whisper tales of the heart's desire
oooooooooooo

[verse 1 - Ocean's Embrace]
In the tide's embrace, we find our song
With every wave, we belong

[Chorus - Harmony's Call]
wooooooo
iiiiiiiii
Together, we rise, voices alight
In the brine of harmony, love takes flight

[Bridge - Serenade's Tide]
Our hearts, a canvas, the sea's soft sigh
Echoing whispers, beneath the sky

[verse 2 - Eternal Waves]
Beyond the horizon, our story flows
In love's gentle current, forever it grows

[outro - Brine of Harmony]
ahhhhhhh oooooo
iiiiiiiiiiiii
In the endless sea, our love's refrain
Forever echoing, again and again
