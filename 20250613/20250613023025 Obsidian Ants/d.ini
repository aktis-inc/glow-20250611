[verse - Ant Dance]
zzzzz ooooooo  
In the shadow of stars  
Crawling rhythms, cosmic scars  
Ants march in endless night  
Pulses echo, void so bright

[build-up - Dark Pulse]
shhhhh oooooooo  
[ethereal whispers]  
Dance, little ants, dance  
Across the dark expanse

[chorus - Obsidian Beat]
iiiii oooooooo  
oooooo dance dance  
Underneath the glowing trance

[bridge - Celestial Patterns]
Ant trails cross the skies  
In the rhythm, truth lies  
Cosmic whispers call  
Into the darkness, we fall

[outro - Neon Fade]
oooooo iiiiiii  
[whispered echoes] Ants... dance... trance...
