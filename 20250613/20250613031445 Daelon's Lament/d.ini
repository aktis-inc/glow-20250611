[verse]  
In the quiet of the dusk, whispers linger  
Roses cradle the past in their bloom  
A heart's echo, gentle and tender  
iiiiiiii

[chorus - wistful longing]  
oooooo   
Longing sighs through the evening breeze  
Memories dance in shadows of time

[bridge - nostalgic reflection]  
Steps on grass, gentle like old tales  
Temple bells sing the heart's refrain  
ahhhhhh

[outro - fading whispers]
