[verse 1 – Harmis Whisper]
In shadows, light finds its way  
Every note, a gentle sway  
Silent echoes, soft and deep  
Dreams awaken, from their sleep

[Chorus – Harmis Reverie]
wooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiiiii  
In Harmis reverie, we find  
A tender touch, a gentle mind

[Bridge - Twilight's Call]  
Softly speak, the night's embrace  
In this quiet, we find our place  
Ahhhh oooooo  
[echoed sigh]  

[verse 2]
With every tear, a story told  
In gentle hands, we find our hold  
Whispered secrets, in the breeze  
Hearts in harmony, at ease

[outro - Harmis Lullaby]  
[soft piano fade]  
ooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiii  
[gentle wind chimes]
