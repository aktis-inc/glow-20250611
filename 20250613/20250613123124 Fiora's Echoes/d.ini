[verse 1 - Soft Glow]
Shadows weave in twilight's grace
Gentle echoes find their space
ooooo iiiiii

[Chorus - Celestial Dance]
Stars align in whispered tone
Hearts entwine, never alone
woooo aaaa

[Bridge - Dreamscape]
Floating on a sea of light
Fiora sings through the night
shhhhhhhhhh

[verse 2 - Echoes]
Reflections glisten, tales unfold
In this moment, love takes hold
oooo iiiii

[outro - Fade to Serenity]
