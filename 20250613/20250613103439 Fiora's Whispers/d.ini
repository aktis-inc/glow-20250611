eeeeee  
[verse 1 – City Pulse]  
Rhythms of the street, voices in the air  
Melodies of the night, weaving stories rare  
ooooohhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Whispered Echoes]  
Gentle breezes hum, secrets in their flow  
Every whispered echo, a tale we know  
ahhhhh ooooo

[Chorus – Urban Symphony]  
Fiora sings, with the city's heart  
A dance of light, where dreams start  
iiiiiii  

[Bridge – Intertwined Paths]  
Threads of sound, paths entwine  
In every beat, a new design  
ssshhhh

[outro – Fade to Light]  
The dawn breaks, softly glowing  
Fiora’s whispers, ever-flowing  
oooooo iiiiii
