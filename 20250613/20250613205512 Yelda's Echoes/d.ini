[verse 1 - Cultural Awakening]
Voices call from the past  
Beats of the earth beneath our feet  
iiiiiiiiii oooooooo

[Pre-Chorus - Rhythmic Pulse]
Traditions merge with the new  
oooooooo  

[Chorus - Yelda's Dance]
A dance through time, an echo  
woooooooo  
Energy flows, we unite

[Bridge - Fusion Flow]
Ancient strings meet the synth  
Harmony of worlds, we blend  
ahhhhhhhh

[outro - Yelda's Echoes]
Festival lights fade, but the sound  
Carries on, timeless and true  
oooooo iiiiiii
