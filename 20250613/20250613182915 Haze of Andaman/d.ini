lyrics = [intro - Misty Shores]
[soft chime]
ooooo iiiiii

[verse 1 – Island Whispers]
Waves speak tales of old
In rhythms bold and gold
The sun dips low, stories unfold
ahhhh ooooo

[chorus – Echoes of Andaman]
iiiiii
Harmonies in the air
Traditions dance with flair
In the haze, the spirits care
woooo

[instrumental - Ethereal Waves]
[soft percussion]

[verse 2 – Melodies Unseen]
In the heart of the sea
Where dreams and silence agree
A symphony of the free
ssshhhh

[bridge - Rhythmic Dance]
Dance with the tide, feel the beat
In every pulse, secrets meet
ahhh ohhh

[outro - Fading Light]
ooooo
In the misty embrace
Where echoes trace
The island's soul, a gentle case
[fade out]
