[verse - Spiritual Awakening]
In the echoes of time, we wander
Paths entwined with the divine
oooooooooooo

[Pre-Chorus - Ethereal Call]  
Where the soul finds its voice
In the rhythm of the heartbeats

[Chorus - Vireya Reverie]  
ahhhhh  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Mystical Journey] 
Let the sitar sing our tales
Tabla guides us through the veils
shhhhhhh

[verse - Harmonious Flow]
In the silence, we discover
Melodies of a world uncovered

[outro - Peaceful Fade]
