lyrics = [intro]
whispers in the wind
oooooo

[verse 1]
City lights flicker, shadows play
In the echoes, memories stay
Kairo calls, through the night
Silent stories, hidden from sight
aaaaa

[chorus]
Resonate, in the heart
Where the echoes never part
woooooo

[verse 2]
In the twilight, dreams collide
In this city, secrets hide
Kairo whispers, through the air
In the silence, we find what's rare
iiiiiii

[bridge]
Lost in echoes, lost in time
In the rhythm, we find rhyme
shhhhh

[outro]
Kairo fades, into the night
With echoes, out of sight
oooooo iiiiiii
