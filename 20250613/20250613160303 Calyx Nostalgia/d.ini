lyrics = [intro - nostalgic echoes]

[verse 1 - Melodic Reverie]
In the tapestry of yesterday's dreams
Voices linger like a soft breeze
ooooo

[Pre-Chorus - Whispered Promise]  
iiiiii
Golden threads weave through time's embrace
Every note a cherished trace

[Chorus - Eternal Dance]  
oooooo  
In the dance of the heart's refrain
Love's echo never fades

[Bridge - Timeless Waltz] 
Shadows of memories sway
In the rhythm of a timeless play
ahhhhhh

[verse 2]
Songs of old, they guide our way
Through the garden where dreams lay
zzzzzz

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[outro - Calyx Nostalgia]
