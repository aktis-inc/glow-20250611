lyrics = [intro - Gentle Echo]
Soft guitar strums, whispers in the air  
oooooo

[verse 1 – Heartbeats]  
In the silence, we find our tune   
Every glance, a gentle swoon  
iiiiiiiiii

[Pre-Chorus – Whispered Dreams]  
Our voices blend, like rivers flow  
Beneath the stars, our secrets glow  
oooooo

[Chorus – Dulcet Fall]  
Falling softly, into your embrace  
Every note, a sweet retrace  
wooooooo  
aaaaaaa

[Bridge - Harmonious Drift]  
We dance in echoes, timeless and true  
In this melody, I find you  
zzzzzzhhh

[verse 2]  
Through shadows, we weave the night  
A symphony, in gentle light  
oooooooooo

[outro - Fading Harmony]  
Gentle echoes, whispers fade  
In the silence, love is made  
ssshhhh oooo]
