Stars align in cosmic play  
Melodies flow, like rivers sway  
Harmony in celestial space  
A dance of light and grace

In the ether, echoes call  
Celara sings, beyond the wall

Whispers of the ancient skies  
In the night, the spirit flies

The universe in gentle sway  
A lullaby to greet the day
