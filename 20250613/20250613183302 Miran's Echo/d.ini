Rhythms rise with the morning light  
Voices echo through the streets

Dance to the pulse of time  
Colors blend in harmony

Tradition whispers in our ears  
Past and present intertwine

Strings sing tales of yore  
Hand in hand, we move as one  
zzzzz

Echoes fade, yet linger on  
A song of unity and joy
