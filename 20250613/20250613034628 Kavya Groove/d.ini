lyrics = [intro beat]
oooooo

[verse 1 – Dance Call]
Rhythms pulse through the night
Colors blend in swirling light
Feel the heartbeat, feel the sound
We rise and dance, unbound

[Chorus – Kavya Groove]
oooh woh woh
Dance to the beat, feel alive
Kavya sets the night on fire

[Bridge – Rhythmic Echo]
Tradition meets the modern sway
In this groove, we find our way
ahhhhhhh

[verse 2 – Vibrant Pulse]
Steps align with the ancient call
In this dance, we stand tall
oooooo

[glitch build-up]
ooooo woah

[outro – Festive Fade]
The night whispers with echoes
Our hearts beat as one, in throes]
