[verse]

Sitar echoes through the mist  
Gentle waves on ancient stones  
ooooo

[Pre-Chorus – Whispering Peaks]  
iiiiiiii  
Mountains hum with secret tales  
In the breeze, a ghostly dance

[Chorus – Korus Dream]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii  
Voices of the past, they call  
Echoes in the heart, they fall

[Bridge - Celestial Flow]  
Rivers of time, they gently weave  
Between the stars, we softly breathe  
ahhhhh  

[outro - Fading Light]
