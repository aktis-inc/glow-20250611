lyrics = [intro wind]

[verse 1 – Urban Echo]
In the city's glow, whispers call
Stars align, guiding through it all
oooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

[Pre-Chorus – Cosmic Dance]
[soft chime]
Streets alive with endless dreams
Every hope, a gentle beam

[Chorus – Nebula Groove]
wooooooo  
iiiiiiiaaaa

[Bridge - Starlit Path]
Path of light, journey unfolds (let's go!)
Winds of change, stories untold (alright!)
Ahhhhhh shhhhhh  
[echoed whisper]

[verse 2]
Rhythms pulse, heartbeats sync
In the night, thoughts softly link
Living dreams, reaching far

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[soft whisper] stars… whispers… alignment… (oo-yeah!)

[outro - Mistral Stars Align]
