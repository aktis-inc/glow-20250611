lyrics = [intro - City Pulse]
(Soft hum) iiiiiiiii  
(Soft hum) ooooooo  

[verse 1 - Night Vibes]  
In the city lights, stories unfold  
Beats echo through streets, tales untold  
With every step, a rhythm of old  
Dance with the night, bold and uncontrolled  

[Chorus - Kairo Beat]  
oooooo  
Dance with the night  
Feel the pulse, rise  
iiiiiiii  

[Bridge - Tradition's Call]  
Echoes of past, in every sound  
Modern beats, where roots are found  
sssssshhhhhhh  

[verse 2 - Fusion Flow]  
Blending time, in melody  
Tradition meets modernity  
Feel the vibe, let it be  
Dance into eternity  

[outro - Kairo Beat]  
(Soft hum) iiiiiiiii  
(Soft hum) ooooooo
