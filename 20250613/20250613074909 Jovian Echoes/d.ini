lyrics = [intro swirl]
Gentle winds... past echoes
Soft glow... whispers

[verse 1]
Time melts in neon haze
Memories dance, alive
Through Jovian skies... we glide
Ahhhhhh

[Chorus – Ethereal Drift]
ooooooo
In echoes, we find truth
Past and present intertwine

[Bridge - Temporal Flow]
Silent whispers guide
Pathways of light unfold
In dreams, we soar... high

[verse 2]
Futures blend with what was
Journey through the stars
In harmony... we find

[outro – Fade to Echoes]
Gentle hum... fades away
ooooo iiiii

[final shimmer]
