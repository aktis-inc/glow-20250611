lyrics = [intro - Neon Glow]
Heartbeat echoes  
City lights awaken  
oooooo  

[verse 1 – Urban Pulse]  
In shadows deep, a whisper calls  
Silent dreams, they rise and fall  
iiiiiiiii  

[Pre-Chorus – Electric Tension]  
oooooo  
Between the beats, the night unfolds  
Every secret, softly told  

[Chorus – Radiant Echo]  
woooooo  
Nivara, in the rhythm we trust  
Eternal glow, from dusk to dust  

[Bridge - Midnight Surge]  
Racing hearts, through neon streams  
Bound by fire, breaking free  
Ahhhh shhhhh  

[verse 2]  
Chasing shadows, we ignite  
Through the darkness, comes the light  
Too alive to hide away  

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[distorted whisper] echoes… rise… resilience… (oo-yeah!)

[outro - Nivara Pulse]
