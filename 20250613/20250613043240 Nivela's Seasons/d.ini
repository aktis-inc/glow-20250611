oooooo  
  
[verse 1 - Gentle Waves]  
We said goodbye to the golden days  
Memories linger, like the ocean's embrace
iiiiiiii  
  
[Pre-Chorus - Nostalgic Breeze]  
ooooo  
The seasons changed but we remain  
In every sunset, we find our way  
  
[Chorus - Timeless Heartbeat]  
wooooo  
Together we stand, through every tide  
Our dreams echo in the sky  
  
[Bridge - Fading Light]  
Moments fade, yet never gone  
In our hearts, they still shine on  
ahhhhhhhh  
  
[outro - Endless Horizon]  
ooooo  
The sun may set, but love prevails  
Nivela's seasons, our eternal tales
