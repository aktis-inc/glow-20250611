lyrics = [intro - Whisper of Night]

Softly under moonlit glow

[verse 1 - Heartfelt Echoes]
Gentle breeze carries your name
In the silence, I hear your voice
A melody in the night
Our hearts beat in perfect time

[Pre-Chorus - Tender Waves]
Whispers weave through the air
In this moment, nothing else matters

[Chorus - Fiora's Embrace]
ooooo
iiiiii
Hold me close, don’t let go
In your arms, I find my home

[Bridge - Eternal Bond]
Beyond stars, our love shall fly
An endless dance in the sky
We rise, we soar, together

[verse 2 - Sweet Refrain]
Every look, a gentle touch
In your eyes, I see forever
A dream that never ends

[outro - Embrace of Dawn]
Softly fades the night, we're one
ooooo
iiiiiiii
