lyrics = [intro gentle]

[verse 1 – Serene Awakening]
In the light, our souls align
Gentle whispers, time entwined
ooooo 
iiiiiiii

[Pre-Chorus – Embrace]
Softly, we become the dream
Floating on a gentle stream

[Chorus – Harmony Unfolds]
aaaaa
In your arms, I find my place
iiiiii
In your eyes, a gentle grace

[Bridge – Ethereal Union]
Together, we breathe as one
Stars align, the journey begun
ahhhh
shhhhh

[verse 2]
Through the night, a symphony
Heartbeats dance in harmony

[outro – Seraph Harmony]
Softly fades the light of dawn
ooooo
As we drift, together drawn]
