soft whispers iiiiiii  
[verse 1 – Eyes of Serenity]  
In the glow of fading light  
Stories linger in the gaze  
Silent echoes in the night  
Hearts entwined, a gentle haze

[chorus – Whispered Promises]  
woooooo  
Tender glances, holding time  
In your eyes, secrets rhyme  
oooooo

[verse 2 – Embrace the Calm]  
Gentle waves of memory  
Flowing softly, setting free  
Through the silence, we align  
In your eyes, worlds combine

[bridge – Unspoken Dreams]  
ahhhh iiiii  
Dreams unfold, quiet and true  
In the depth, I see you  
shhhhh

[outro – Serene Eyes]  
Softly fading, whispered sighs  
In your gaze, the story lies  
ooooooo]
