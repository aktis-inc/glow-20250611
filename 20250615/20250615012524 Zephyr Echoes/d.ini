lyrics = [intro - gentle breeze]

[verse 1]
In the hush of twilight's embrace  
Winds weave tales of yesteryear  
Through the echoes, a soft trace  
Of dreams once whispered clear  
ooooo zzzzz

[chorus]
Zephyr's song, a gentle sigh  
Softly carried through the night  
In the dance of stars and sky  
Whispers fade, yet hold tight  
iiiiiii aaaaa

[bridge - ethereal interlude]
Through the veils of time, we soar  
On wings of harmony, we glide  
Each note a key to unlock the door  
To realms where dreams abide  
shhhhhh

[verse 2]
From the heart of silence springs  
A melody that softly sings  
Of forgotten hopes, it brings  
A gentle touch on gossamer wings  
oooo aaahhh

[outro - fading whispers]
Zephyr echoes, softly wane  
In the silence, dreams remain  
iiiiii ooooo
