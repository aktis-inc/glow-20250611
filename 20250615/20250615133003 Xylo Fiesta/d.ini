[verse 1 – Sunrise Celebration]
Guitar strings awaken, hearts are light
Colors dance in rhythm, morning bright
oooooo iiiiiiii

[Chorus – Joyful Pulse]
Clap your hands, feel the beat
Life's a dance, move your feet
oooo aaaa

[Bridge - Brass Serenade]
Trumpets call the soul to play
In this festival, we sway
eeeeee ooo

[verse 2 – Daylight Revelry]
Accordion sings tales untold
Stories of joy and heart of gold
shhhhh iiiii

[outro - Fiesta Fade]
Crowds disperse, memories stay
In our hearts, the music plays
aaaaa ooooo]
