[verse 1 - Echoes of Past]
In the quiet of the evening  
Memories softly play  
Time slips through my fingers  
Yet it feels like yesterday  
oooooohhh  

[Pre-Chorus - Whispered Time]
Gentle whispers in the breeze  
Carrying the songs of old  
Fading moments we hold dear  
In the warmth, our tales unfold

[Chorus - Serene Reflection]
wooooo  
iiiiiiaaaa  
In the echoes, we find solace  
In the melodies, we find peace  
ooooooooo  
iiiiiiiiii  

[Bridge - Nostalgic Waves]
Dreams float on gentle waters  
Reflections of what used to be  
In the stillness of the heart  
We find our harmony

[outro - Fading Light]
ooooooooh  
As the sun kisses the horizon  
And the stars begin to glow  
We drift into the night  
With echoes of long ago  
shhhhhhh
