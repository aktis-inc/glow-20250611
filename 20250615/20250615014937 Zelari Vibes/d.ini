lyrics = [intro - ocean whisper]

[verse - gentle embrace]
The waves carry secrets untold
In the rhythm of your heart

[chorus - sunset glow]
ooooo  
iiiiiiii

[bridge - tropical dream]
Lost in the breeze, time stands still
Your voice, a gentle lullaby
ahhhh

[verse 2 - soulful echoes]
Every note, a path to the stars
Guided by the moon's soft light

[outro - fading light]
The horizon calls, with whispers of tomorrow
ooooo oooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiii
