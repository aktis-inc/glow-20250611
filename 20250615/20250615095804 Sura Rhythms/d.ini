[verse - Sura Path]
Flow through the streets, where the old meets the new
Beats that echo, rhythm breaks through
ooohhh

[chorus - Tradition's Beat]
Sura guides, the sound of change
Melodies blend, in a timeless range
oooo aaaaa

[bridge - Urban Pulse]
City lights, ancient rites
Sura whispers, in the night
shhhhhhh

[outro - Rhythms End]
Echoes fade, but the beat remains
Sura's rhythm, in our veins
