[verse 1 - Neon Streets]
Lights flash, we chase the night
Echoes call, we ride in time
zzzzzzh

[Pre-Chorus - Pulse]
Eyes meet, a spark ignites
Every beat, a thrill defined
oooooo

[Chorus - Odyssey]
woooooo
Ride the wave of sound
In this city, we are found
iiiiii

[Bridge - Electric Dreams]
Our hearts sync, electric streams
In this moment, we are free
ahhhhhh

[verse 2 - Urban Beat]
Rhythms dance, a vibrant show
Steps align, we let it flow
shhhhhh

[glitch build-up]
ooooo iiiiii

[outro - Quaver Odyssey]
Journey ends, but echoes stay
In this quaver, we find our way]
