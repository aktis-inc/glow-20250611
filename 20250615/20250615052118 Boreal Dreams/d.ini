whispering winds iiiii oooooo

[verse 1 – Echoes of Time]
Distant lands call, voices of old
In the tapestry of stars, stories unfold

Boreal dreams, where oceans meet skies
In the dance of light, all shadows rise
ooooo iiiiii

[Bridge – Serene Voyage]
Floating on the breeze, timeless and free
In the gentle embrace of eternity
zzzzzz aaaaa

[outro]
Ethereal whispers, fading into night iiiiiiiiii oooooooo]
