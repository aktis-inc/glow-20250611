oooooo  

[verse - Dancing Zephyr]  
Winds of old, tales untold  
In the sky, dreams unfold  
ooooo  

[Chorus - Celestial Breeze]  
Flowing through the timeless trees  
Whisper softly with the breeze  
iiiiii  

[Bridge - Ethereal Echo]  
Beyond the hills, where silence lies  
A gentle song in azure skies  
shhhhh  

[outro - Tranquil Fade]  
The melody fades, but never dies  
ooooo
