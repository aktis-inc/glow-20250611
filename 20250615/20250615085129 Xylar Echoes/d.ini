[verse - Whisper of Time]  
In the quiet of night, whispers call  
Memories dance, like shadows on the wall  
oooooo aaaaaa  
iiiiiiii

[chorus - Echoes of Xylar]  
Every heartbeat echoes through the past  
Fleeting moments, forever they last  
wooooo  
yyyyy

[bridge - Dreamscape]  
In dreams, we find our way back  
To places where the heart once stayed  
ahhhh ooooo  

[outro - Fading Light]  
The echoes fade, but never truly die  
In the silence, Xylar and I
