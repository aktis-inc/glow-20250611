[verse 1 - Quiet Reverie]  
Strummed chords echo through the morning light  
Stories untold, whispered by the winds  
oooooo  
  
[chorus - Roaring Heartbeat]  
Feel the pulse, the earth beneath our feet  
Every beat a tale, every step a journey  
  
[bridge - Echoes of Time]  
In the silence of the night, dreams take flight  
Memories linger, like shadows at dawn  
iiiiiiii  
  
[verse 2 - Resilient Spirit]  
Face the storm with courage, heart unyielding  
Through the struggles, we find our song  
zzzzzz

The world quiets as the day ends  
Xylar's roar, a timeless echo  
ooooooo
