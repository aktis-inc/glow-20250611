lyrics = [intro - Soft Prelude]

[verse 1 - Water's Edge]
Whispering waves tell stories   
Of the heart's gentle longing  
Silent moments unfold  
Under the golden twilight

[chorus - Elara's Embrace]
ooooooo  
iiiiiiiiii  
Embrace the horizon  
Elara's whisper carries us  

[bridge - Dusk's Serenade]
Violin sings a lullaby  
To the stars emerging above  
Gentle echoes of the past  
Resonate in the soul

[outro - Fade to Dream]
shhhhhhhh  
Softly fades the light  
In Elara's embrace
