woooo  

[verse 1]  
Underneath the fading light,  
Hearts align, stars ignite,  
In the echo of your gaze,  
Time slows, in endless ways  
oooo  

[chorus - Glimmer]  
Dance with me, in this glow,  
Feel the rhythm, let it flow,  
Glimmer of love, in our eyes,  
Together we rise, to the skies  
iiiiii  

[bridge - Twilight Dream]  
Hold on tight, as dreams unfold,  
In your warmth, stories told,  
Every moment, a gentle sigh,  
In this world, just you and I  
zzzzzz  

[outro - Fading Echoes]  
ooooo  
Underneath the twilight, love remains,  
In this glimmer, forever our names  
iiiiiiii
