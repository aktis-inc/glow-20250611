[verse 1 – Desert Bloom]  
Sunflowers sway, under the sky  
Your eyes, a horizon, where dreams fly  
oooooo  
iiiiiiii  

[chorus – Serenade Echo]  
Girasol, in the night, whisper to the moon  
iiiiii ooooooo  
Your love, a melody, in sweet tune  
ahhhh  

[verse 2 – Heart's Horizon]  
In the desert's embrace, we find our way  
Stars guide us, love will stay  
zzzzzz  

[bridge – Sunlit Whisper]  
Your voice, a gentle breeze, in my soul  
Together, we make each other whole  
ahhh ooo  

[outro – Sunset Glow]  
Under the desert sky, love's serenade  
Girasol, forever, in the shade  
iiiiiiii ooooooo  
[soft strum fade]
