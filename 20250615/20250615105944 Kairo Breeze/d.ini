lyrics = [intro - Ocean Whisper]
woooo oooo

[verse 1 - Gentle Tides]  
The sun dips low, in the sky's embrace  
Guitar strings hum, a soft caress  
Breezes carry, whispers of the sea  

[chorus - Kairo's Call]  
oooooo  
Kairo breeeeze, caaaaarry me  
To where the palms sway so free  
iiiiii aaaaaa

[bridge - Sunset Glow]  
Feel the warmth, let it unfold  
In this moment, time stands still  
oooooo

[outro - Fading Light]  
woooo iiiii  
As the sun sets, the day unwinds  
Kairo's touch, gentle and kind
