lyrics = [intro - whispered echoes]
oooooo

[verse 1 - Urban Pulse]  
Ancient whispers in city lights  
A bridge of dreams, where shadows dance  
wiii ooo wooo

[Pre-Chorus - Fusion Flow]  
Synths blend with the past’s call  
A melody of echoes, timeless and bold  
oooooo

[Chorus - Wavelle Echoes]  
Rivers of sound, flowing through time  
A harmony of worlds, serenely collide  
iiii ooo aaaaa

[Bridge - Ethereal Bridge]  
Steps on the path, echoes in the night  
Tradition sings in the glow of neon  
shhhh ooo

[outro - Fade to Silence]  
The future’s song, a woven thread  
In echoes of the past, a new dawn shines  
oooooo iiiii]
