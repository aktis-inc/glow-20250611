[verse 1 - Tranquil Beginnings]
Gentle dawn, colors weave
Through the mist, dreams unspool
Kaira's song, whispers true
oooooo

[chorus - Harmonious Echo]
Sitar sings, hearts align
Tabla's beat, time unwinds
wooo iiiii

Flow of time, river's glide
Echoes dance, in the night
ahhhh ooooo

[outro - Fading Light]
Whispers fade, stars ignite
Kaira's tune, endless flight
oooo aaaaa
