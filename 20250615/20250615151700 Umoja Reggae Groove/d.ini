woooo ooooooo

[verse 1 – Sunlit Paths]  
Rhythm flows, the island breathes  
Unity in every beat we feel

[Chorus – Umoja Spirit]  
Jah brings the groove, alive with light  
In the dance, we find our sight  
oooooo aaaaa

[Bridge – Breeze of Freedom]  
Ride the waves of time, let go  
With Umoja, spirits grow  
ahhh ooooh yeeeaaah

[outro – Sunset Harmony]  
Waves of sound, whispers of peace  
In unity, our souls release  
iiiiii oooooo
