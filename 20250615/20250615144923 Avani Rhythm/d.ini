lyrics = [intro - rain begins]
oooooo aaaaaaa
[tabla solo fades in]

[verse 1 - maati calls]
Beneath the dust and stone
There's a waiting heart
For the sky's whisper
To tear the grey apart
zzzzz zzz zzz zzzzz

[pre-chorus - build up]
Megh gathers low now
A promise held in humid air
Pulse begins to quicken
Knowing release is near

[chorus - drop]
AVANI! feel the rhythm break!
Brishti falls, the earth awakes!
ooooooooooo
yeahhhh yeahhhhh
Every drop a beat now
Washing the past away

[verse 2 - sur of the storm]
Flute cry across the field
A melody of ancient pain
Transforming into energy
Washed clean by the rain

[instrumental break - flute and synth interplay]
[rhythmic pulses]
uuuuu iiiiiiii
aaaaa ooooooo

[bridge - connecting skies]
Cloud friend to the ground below
A cycle ever spinning
Finding the flow, the only way
A new beginning is winning

[chorus - final drop]
AVANI! feel the rhythm break!
Brishti falls, the earth awakes!
ooooooooooo
yeahhhh yeahhhhh
Every drop a beat now
Washing the past away

[outro - fade out with rain and tabla]
shhhhhhhh shhhhhhhh
ooooooo
