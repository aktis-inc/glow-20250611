lyrics = [intro – Soft Light]

[guitar intro]

[verse 1 – Morning Glow]
A whisper in the dawn
Silent echoes, soft and long
Gentle rays, the world reborn
oooooo

[chorus – Light's Embrace]
iiiiii
Glimmers in the air
Dancing shadows, everywhere
Warmth that lingers, in the glow

[bridge – Daybreak]
A secret melody unfolds
In the light, a story told
Soft and tender, whispers near

[outro – Fade]
oooooo
iiiiii
Glimmering echoes of the day
Carried on the breeze, away
