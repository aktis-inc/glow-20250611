Shimmering lights, the night awakes  
City's heartbeat, a vibrant shake

Chasing dreams, neon streams  
Through the night, endless beams

Feel the rhythm, pure delight

Electric pulse, in my veins  
Life ignites, no more chains  
zzzzzz

Glowing bright, city's sound  
In the night, we're unbound  
ooooooo
