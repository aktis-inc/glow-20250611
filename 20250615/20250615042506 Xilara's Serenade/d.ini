[verse 1 - Heart's Echo]  
In the night, whispers of the past  
Fading shadows, stories untold

Dance with me under starlit skies  
Feel the rhythm, in every heartbeat

In your eyes, the world ignites  
Emotions flow, like rivers wide

Hands entwined, paths converge  
Love's melody, eternal surge

Our serenade, forever sings  
In the breeze, our legacy rings
