wooooo  
ooooo

[verse 1 - Urban Whispers]  
City lights flicker, shadows dance  
A gentle touch in the night's embrace  
Silent echoes whisper secrets  
In the rhythm, we find our place  
mmmmm

[chorus - Xylo Pulse]  
oooooo  
In the sway, we lose ourselves  
Under the influence, time melts  
Beyond the edge, we drift  
Aaaaaahhhhh

[verse 2 - Neon Dreams]  
Reflections ripple, stories untold  
In the depth of night, we unfold  
A soft breeze carries our sighs  
In the glow, we rise  

[bridge - Midnight Echo]  
wooo ooo  
Lost in the sound, found in the night  
A melody that feels just right  
Ahhhhhhh iiiiiii

[outro - Fading Glow]  
The city sleeps, but our tale lingers  
In the quiet, the music fingers  
Xylo Influence, a gentle sway  
Into the night, we drift away  
oooooo
