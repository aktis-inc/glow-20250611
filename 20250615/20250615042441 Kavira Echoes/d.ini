lyrics = [intro - Gentle Breeze]
[whispering echoes]  
ooooo

[verse 1 – Time's Embrace]  
In the quiet dawn, we wander  
Paths entwined like ancient tales  
Softly spoken dreams, unfold  
Kavira sings through heartbeats

[Pre-Chorus – Whispering Leaves]  
[gentle hum]  
iiiiiii  
Memories in the rustling air  
A melody of time's embrace

[Chorus – Timeless Harmony]  
ooooo  
iiiiiii  
In the echoes, love remains  
Kavira's touch, forever stays

[Bridge – Nostalgic Dance]  
Dance of shadows, light and dark  
Dreams awaken, love's embark  
ahhhh  
ssshhh

[verse 2]  
Through the echoes, we are found  
Silent whispers, love profound  
Kavira holds us in its fold

[outro - Echoes Fade]  
[soft instrumental]  
ooooo  
iiiiiii  
In the quiet, love remains  
Kavira's song, forever stays
