ahhhhhhh  
[verse - Echoes of Time]  
In a land where dreams converge  
Silent whispers carry tales  
oooooo  
[Chorus - Eternal Dance]  
Dance to rhythms of the past  
Echoing through the heart's embrace  
[Bridge - Whispered Promises]  
Promises carried on the wind  
Softly sung, gently heard  
iiiiiiii

Dreams linger, softly fade  
Into the night, they serenade  
ooooo
