Aaaaaa ooooooo

[verse - Sacred Whispers]  
In the heart of the lotus bloom  
Voices rise like the morning sun  
Dhimi dhimi, rhythm of life  
In each breath, a universe hums  
oooooo iiiiiii

[chorus - Divine Union]  
Flute's call, echo through the soul  
Tabla's pulse, the earth's heartbeat  
Uvalo sings in the cosmic flow  
Harmony in every beat  
ahhhhhhh

[bridge - Celestial Dance]  
Stars align in sacred patterns  
Galaxies twirl to the ancient hymn  
In the silence, find the answers  
Within the spirit's gentle gleam  
oooo iiiiii iiiiiii

[outro - Twilight Reverie]  
Eternal, the sound of peace  
As the night embraces day  
In the calm, our spirits cease  
To wander, to find the way  
oooooo iiiiiii aaaa]
