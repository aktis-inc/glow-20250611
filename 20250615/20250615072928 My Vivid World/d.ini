lyrics = [intro - Sunset Glow]
Oooooooo
Aaaaaaaa

[verse 1 - Fading Light]
Shadows stretch across the plain
Another day surrenders slow
The air is thick with unspoken truth
Just whispers on the breeze

[Pre-Chorus - Echoes Calling]
Something stirs inside the quiet
A familiar melody
Reaching back across the years
Pulling at the thread

iiiiiii iiiii

[Chorus - Vivid Colors]
This is my world, painted loud
Every moment, every sound
Reflections in the water deep
Secrets that the mountains keep

uuuuuu uuuuuuu
Yaaaaa yaaaaa

[instrumental break - Sitar & Strings]
[Emotional swell]

[verse 2 - Shifting Hues]
The path I walk is not my own
But footprints left for me
Guidance in the dust I tread
A legacy unbound

[Pre-Chorus - Echoes Calling]
Something stirs inside the quiet
A familiar melody
Reaching back across the years
Pulling at the thread

iiiiiii iiiii

[Chorus - Vivid Colors]
This is my world, painted loud
Every moment, every sound
Reflections in the water deep
Secrets that the mountains keep

uuuuuu uuuuuuu
Yaaaaa yaaaaa

[bridge - Stillness]
In the silence, I can hear
The beating of a heart
A rhythm steady, strong, and clear
Never truly apart

[instrumental break - Tabla & Dholak Rhythm]
[Energetic build]

[Outro - Vivid Reflections]
The colors fade, but the light remains
Deep within my soul
A vivid world, forever mine
Holding on, letting go

ooooo aaaaaa mmmmmm
