Soft breeze, gentle hum  
Stars whisper tales  
ooooohh

[verse 1 – Echoes of the Past]  
In the jungle, whispers rise  
Lion strides with grace  
Elephant's gentle gaze  
Together, they weave the night  
zzzzhh ooo

[Chorus – Harmonious Dance]  
oooooo  
oooooo  
Together in harmony, under celestial skies  
oooooo

[Bridge - Tales of Old]  
Ancient rhythms guide their steps  
Stories of old, softly kept  
ahhhh

[outro - Zephyr's Tale]  
Wind carries the melody  
Across the land, dreams unfold  
ooooo  
aaaaa
