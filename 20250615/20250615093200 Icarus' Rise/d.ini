lyrics = [intro - Neon Glow]
woooooo  
oooooo

[verse 1 - Rise of Icarus]  
Wings spread wide, chasing the light  
Skies open up, dreams ignite  
Every step echoes in the night  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

[Pre-Chorus - Ascend]  
oooooo  
On the edge, feeling the height  
Gravity lost, heart in flight

[Chorus - Neon Dreams]  
wooooooo  
Rise above, never looking down  
iiiiiiiiiiiiii

[Bridge - Urban Pulse]  
Streetlights guide the way, forward  
Chasing shadows, never backward  
shhhh ooooo

[verse 2 - Burning Bright]  
In the glow, visions unfold  
Stories untold, bold and cold  
Every moment, carved in gold

[glitch build-up]  
sssshhhhh ooo

[Outro - Icarus' Descent]  
Falling stars, blazing trails  
Through the night, leaving tales  
wooooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiii
