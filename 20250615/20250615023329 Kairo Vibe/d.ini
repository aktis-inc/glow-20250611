lyrics = [intro beat]
Rhythm of the island, echo through the night
Pulsing with the ocean, stars ignite
ooooooo
[verse]
Feel the heat, move your feet
Tropical breeze, set us free
In the rhythm, we unite
Dance until the morning light
[Pre-Chorus]
wooooooo
Under stars, we find our way
Every beat, a call to stay
[Chorus]
iiiiiiiiii
Kairo nights, where dreams ignite
Dance with me, in neon light
[Bridge - Rhythmic Pulse]
Feel the vibe, let it flow
Through the night, let it show
ahhhh shhhhh
[verse 2]
In the groove, we belong
Every beat, a timeless song
Energy, let it rise
Dance beneath the endless skies
[glitch build-up]
ooooo
[outro - Kairo Vibe]  
Dance forever, in the glow  
Feel the rhythm, let it grow
