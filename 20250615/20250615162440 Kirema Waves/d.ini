[verse 1 - Echoes of Tradition]
Rhythms of the past, alive
In the heart of the hills, stories thrive  
ooooo shhhhhh
  
[chorus - Soulful Call]
Kirema waves, caress the land  
Melodies of a forgotten strand  
ahhh iiiiiiii oooo

[bridge - Lament of Time]
In echoes we find our way  
Through the whispers of yesterday  
ssssh aaaa oooo

[outro - Fading Light]
Kirema, carry us through  
In the dance of the old and new
