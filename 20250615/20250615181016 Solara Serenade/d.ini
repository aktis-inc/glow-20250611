woooooo

[verse 1 - Sunlit Dance]
Feel the warmth, under the glow
Rhythms flow, hearts ignite

iiiiiiiiii
Dance with the tide, dreams arise
Solara's light, in our eyes

[Bridge - Tropical Echo]
Harmony sings, in the breeze
With every wave, we breathe
oooo aaaa

Life unfolds, colors bright
In the night, stars align

Under Solara, we find our song
