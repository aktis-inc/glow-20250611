[verse 1 – Echoes of Earth]
Soft earth whispers, past unfolds  
Dreams like rivers, stories told  
oooo aaaa

[chorus – Sky's Embrace]
Zephyr's song, carries on  
Through the mist, echoes drawn  
iiii oooo

[bridge – Tranquil Flow]
Harmony dances in the wind  
Nature's voice, in silence pinned  
oooo aaaa

[outro – Fading Light]
Whispering tales, dissolve in night  
In the calm, find your light  
iiii aaaa
