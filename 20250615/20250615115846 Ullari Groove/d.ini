[verse 1]  
Shadows dance in the sunlight glow  
Paths intertwine, where do they go?  
mmmmmmmm  
  
[Chorus - Soul's Journey]

Feel the rhythm, feel the flow  
Dance with life, let it show  
  
[Bridge - Echoing Joy]  
Steps align with the beat  
Heart and earth in sync  
ahhhhhh  
  
[outro - Sunset Groove]
