lyrics = [intro - gentle waves]
nnnnnn ooooooo

[verse - Melody's Whisper]
Strings dance in twilight's embrace  
Harmony flows like a gentle stream  
A tale of time, sung by the breeze

[Chorus - Celestial Drift]
wooooooo  
iiiiiii ohhhhhhh  
nnnnnnn  
Echoes of the past, in the now  
Stars align, guiding the soul

[Bridge - Eternal Harmony] 
In the silence, music breathes  
Tradition's thread, woven anew  
sssssshhhhh oooohhh

[outro - Nirav Serenade]
Harmony fades into the night  
Journey's end, yet it begins anew  
nnnnnn aaaaaa
