[verse]
City lights flicker, stories unfold  
In the rhythm of the streets, hearts are bold  
ooooooo

[chorus – Dance Pulse]
Feel the beat, feel the night  
Fiora's rhythm, pure delight  
iiiiiiiiiii  

[bridge – Neon Glow]
Echoes of laughter, whispers of dreams  
In this urban tapestry, nothing's as it seems  
sssssssshhhhhh

[outro – Dusk's Embrace]
As the night unveils its grace  
Fiora's rhythm, in every place
