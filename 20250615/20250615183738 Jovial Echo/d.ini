lyrics = [intro - Echoes of the Night]

[verse - Shadows Speak]
In the depth of silent woods
Echoes whisper (truths untold)
Through the mist (secrets unfold)
Jjjjjjj 

[Pre-Chorus - Whispering Wind]
ooooo  
Whispering in the dark
All the voices (call my name)

[Chorus - Silent Reverie]
Woooooo   
Silence carries (depth and pain)
Jjjjjjj echoes remain

[Bridge - Shadow Dance]
Through the shadows (I wander)
In the silence (I wonder)
Oooohhhh aaaaaaaa

[outro - Fading Light]
The echoes fade (into the night)
Silence remains (as my guide)
