lyrics = [intro - Soft Echo]
whispers of dreams
ooooooo

[verse 1 – Floating Memories]
In the sky, where echoes play
Time holds its breath, soft and gray
Laughter in the wind sways
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Gentle Whispers]
oooooo
Heartbeats in the clouds
Memories speak aloud

[Chorus – Skybound Dreams]
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Timeless Echo]
Here, where light bends
The past blends, it sends
An echo, a call, to the skies
Ahhh shhhh

[verse 2]
In this ethereal place
Time dances with grace
Soft whispers, a gentle embrace

[glitch build-up]
ssshhhh oooo

[outro - Zephyr Playground]
ooooo
Linger, in the playground of dreams"]
