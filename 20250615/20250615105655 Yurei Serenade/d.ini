wooo oooo

[verse - Moonlit Echoes]
In the shimmer of old tales  
Dancing shadows on the wall  
Ancient voices call, a digital lullaby  
Yurei's serenade in the night

[chorus - Ethereal Dance]
wooooooo  
iiiiiiii

[bridge - Fusion Dreams]
Tradition whispers, future sings  
Harmony in the air, a gentle breeze  
A serenade from the ethereal realm  
oooooohhh

[outro - Fade into Dawn]
ooooohhhh  
Soft echoes linger, night retreats
