lyrics = [intro - Echoing Steps]
(footsteps on pavement)  

[verse 1 – Urban Pulse]  
The city's heartbeat echoes  
In alleys where stories arise  
Destiny dances in shadows  
oooooo  

[Chorus – Gritty Flow]  
wooooo  
Deep within the beat  
Destiny and fate meet  
iiiiiiiiii  

[Bridge - Neon Glow]  
Graffiti whispers secrets  
Neon dreams on wet streets  
ahhhhhh  

[verse 2 – Barrio Dreams]  
Life in the fast lane, vivid  
Every corner tells a tale  
In the rhythm, we live it  

[outro - Fade to Echo]  
sshhhh ooooo
