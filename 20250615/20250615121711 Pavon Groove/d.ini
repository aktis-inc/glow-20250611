[verse 1 – Electric Streets]  
Neon signs light the way  
In the city, where dreams play  
oooo oooo

[Chorus – Pavon Pulse]  
Feel the groove under city skies  
Dancing lights in our eyes  
iiii iiiii

[Bridge – Urban Heartbeat]  
Pavon whispers through the night  
Guiding us in the glowing light  
ahhhhhh

[verse 2 – Rhythmic Echoes]  
Every corner holds a tune  
In this vibrant, endless room  
shhhhhh ooo

[outro – Fade to Groove]  
Neon fades, but the rhythm stays  
Through the city's endless maze  
oooo woooooo
