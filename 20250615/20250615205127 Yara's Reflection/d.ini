lyrics = [intro - Urban Echo]
City whispers in the night
Rhythms pulse, flickering light
ooooooo iiiiiiii

[verse 1 – Streets' Gaze]
Walking paths of dreams untold
Stories carved in urban gold
Thoughts align with every beat
Echoing down every street

[Pre-Chorus – Reflective Flow]
ooooooo
Life unfolds, a mirror's view
Every step, a chance anew

[Chorus – Yara's Insight]
iiiiiiiii
Feel the vibe, let it guide
Through the shadows, side by side

[Bridge – Echoes of Thought]
Silent echoes, mind's retreat
Find the truth within the beat
ahhhhhhhh

[verse 2]
Paths converge, the city's heart
Every whisper plays its part
Dreams and doubts, a tangled thread
In this rhythm, we're all led

[drop - Rhythmic Reflection]
oooooooooo

[outro - Dusk's Embrace]
