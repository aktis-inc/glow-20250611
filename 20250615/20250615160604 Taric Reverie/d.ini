lyrics = [intro]
oooooo aaaaa  
[verse ‚Äì Whisper of Tradition]  
In the quiet dawn, where dreams awake  
A gentle path, through the heart's landscape  
Serenity calls, through ancient tones  
With whispers of peace, in the unknown  
zzzzzzhhh

[Chorus ‚Äì Echo of the Soul]  
woooo  
Harmony flows, like rivers of gold  
In Taric's embrace, stories unfold  
ooooo iiiiiii  

[Bridge ‚Äì Mystic Reverie]  
A dance of light, on waters serene  
Reflections of past, where we've been  
A gentle breeze, carries the song  
Of timeless tales, where spirits belong  
ooooo aaaa  
[soft breath]

[outro ‚Äì Taric Reverie]  
In the silent glow, where dreams reside  
A melody whispers, with Taric as guide  
shhhhhhh ooo
