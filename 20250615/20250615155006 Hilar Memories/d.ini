[verse 1 – Tapestry of Time]  
Threads of yesterday, woven in light  
Memories linger, soft and bright  
iiiiiiii  

[Pre-Chorus – Heartstrings]  
Gentle chords, emotions sway  
In every note, stories play  
oooooo

Hiiiiilar, through time and space  
In your eyes, I find my place  
wooooo  

[Bridge - Eternal Bonds]  
Whispered moments, never fade  
In the silence, love's serenade  
ahhhh  

[verse 2 – Woven Dreams]  
Days gone by, yet still they sing  
In our hearts, forever spring  
zzzzzz

Gentle breeze, echoes remain  
In our hearts, love's refrain  
ooooo]
