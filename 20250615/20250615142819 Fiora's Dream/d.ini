[verse 1 - Sunrise Dance]
In the valley where dreams awaken
oooooo
Colors weave through the dawn
iiiiii

[Pre-Chorus - Mountain Call]
Echoes of the past, calling
Through the hills, we rise
oooooooo

[Chorus - Fiesta in the Heart]
Fiora's dream, a dance of light
In every step, a story told
ooooo iiiii

[Bridge - Whispering Winds]
The night whispers, secrets unfold
Dancing through the stars, bold
ssshhh ooooo

[verse 2 - Echoing Laughter]
Laughter rides on the breeze
Carrying tales of old and new
iiiiii

[outro - Dream's Embrace]
Fiora's dream, forever bright
In the valley, where hearts unite
oooooo iiiii]
