lyrics = [intro - soft melody] iiiiii aaaa

[verse - gentle flow]
Veils of dusk, weaving dreams  
Echoes linger, soft and warm  
oooooooooo

[chorus - heartfelt embrace]
iiiiiiii aaaa  
In the silence, tales unfold  
Whispers of the heart's own song  

[bridge - ethereal whisper]
Dreams in twilight, gentle sway  
Songs of longing, softly play  
ahhhh ooooo

[outro - serene fade]
iiiiiiiii  
Echoes fade, night descends  
Quillon's serenade, never ends  
shhhhh aaa]
