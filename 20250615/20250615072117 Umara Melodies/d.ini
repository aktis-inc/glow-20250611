[verse 1]
In the silent whispers of the night  
Memories dance like shadows  
Every moment a soft embrace  
Holding onto the light

[chorus - gentle waves]

Feel the warmth, the gentle breeze  
Through the echoes of the past

In the quiet, we find solace  
Moments linger, never fade

Embrace the calm, the gentle sway  
As the day turns into dreams
