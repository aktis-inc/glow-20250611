[verse 1 - Urban Pulse]
City lights dance, stories untold  
In the silence, strength unfolds  
oooooo iiiiii

[Pre-Chorus - Rising Echo]  
Power in whispers, echoes of the heart  
Every shadow plays its part

[Chorus - Kiora's Anthem]  
woooooo  
Together we rise, no fear of the fall  
Kiora's reflection, stronger through all  

[Bridge - Neon Dreams] 
In the glow, we find our way  
Guided by the light, no words to say  
ahhhhhh shhhhhh  

[outro - Dawn’s Embrace]
Embrace the dawn, feel the light  
Kiora's journey, out of the night  
oooooo iiiiii
