[verse 1 – Whispering Tides]
In the quiet, echoes dance
Shadows embrace the light
Softly, dreams unfold

[pre-chorus – Heart's Whisper]
ooooo iiiii
Tender notes, a gentle breeze
Carrying secrets untold

[chorus – Echo's Serenade]
woooo ooooo
In your eyes, a universe
Feelings ripple, never fade

[bridge – Soul's Reverie]
Hearts connected, timeless bond
Under starlit skies, we soar
Ahhhh shhhhh

[verse 2 – Silent Promises]
Words unspoken, yet understood
In this moment, we find peace
Together, we remain

[outro – Fading Echoes]
iiiiiii ooooo
Lingering notes, a sweet refrain
The echo fades, but love remains
