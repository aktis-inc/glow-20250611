lyrics = [intro whisper]
Soft light, gentle breeze  
Heartstrings echo, melodies tease  

[verse 1]  
In the quiet of dawn's embrace  
We find our place, a tranquil space  
iiiiii oooooo  
Beneath the sky's tender gaze  

[chorus]  
ooooo  
Harmony flows, like rivers we know  
In Ithra's glow, our hearts softly glow  

[verse 2]  
Through whispers of the past we tread  
With every step, the silence spreads  
A journey where our souls have led  

[bridge]  
oooo aaaa  
In dreams we weave, in light we believe  
Bound by the stars, our hearts never grieve  

[outro - fade]  
Softly we drift, in the warmth of our gift  
iiiiii oooooo  
In Ithra's harmony, we gently lift
