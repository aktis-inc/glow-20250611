lyrics = [intro - Storm's Call]

[verse 1 – Xylar's Quest]
Through mist and shadow, he rides
With the stars as guides, his fate awaits
ooooooo aaaaah

[Pre-Chorus - Rising Thunder]
Winds of destiny whisper in the night
The path is forged in fire, bold and bright 

[Chorus - Saga's Echo]
Xylar stands, a hero born
In the storm, his legend sworn
iiiiiiii

[Bridge - Myth's Embrace]
The dragon's roar, the phoenix's flight
With sword in hand, he claims the light
[echoing call]

[guitar solo - Wings of Valor]

[verse 2]
Bound by honor, bound by might
His story carved in endless night
wooooooo ooo

[Chorus - Saga's Echo]
Xylar stands, a hero born
In the storm, his legend sworn

[outro - Hero's Ascend]
The tale of Xylar, forever told
In the hearts of brave and bold
aaaaaahhhh]
