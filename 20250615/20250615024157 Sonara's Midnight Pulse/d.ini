lyrics = [intro echo]

[verse 1 – Midnight Stroll]
In the city shadows, whispers call
Neon dreams unfold, through the mist we fall
oooo iiiii

[Pre-Chorus – Whispered Secrets]
Softly, the night speaks
Secrets wrapped in silence

[Chorus – Sonara's Pulse]
Beating in the dark, the pulse of the night
ahhhh oooooo  
iiiiii

[Bridge – Echoing Steps]
Steps in the rain, where the echoes hide
Lost in the glow, where shadows confide
sssshhhhh

[verse 2]
In the silence of the streets, stories untold
Through the haze, we find the gold

[glitch build-up]  
zzzz oooo  

[Outro – Embrace the Night]
In the quiet, we find our voice
Sonara's song, a whispered choice
oooo iiiiiiii
