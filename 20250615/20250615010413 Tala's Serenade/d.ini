[verse 1 - Heart's Calling]
In the echo of the past,
The strings of time play on,
Oooooo iiiii

[Chorus - Tala's Serenade]
Dance with me, in the moonlit glow,
Our souls entwined, where dreams flow,
Ahhhh oooooo

[Bridge - Festive Rhythms]
Feel the heartbeat, a tale untold,
Tradition's warmth in the night's fold,
Ooo iiiii zzzz

[verse 2 - Whispered Promises]
Beneath the stars, we find our way,
In every note, love finds its say,
Ahhh oooo

[outro - Melodic Farewell]
The night fades, but memories sing,
In Tala's serenade, hearts take wing,
Iiiii oooooo
