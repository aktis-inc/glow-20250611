[verse 1 - City Lights]
Echoes of the night, whispers clear
A rhythm found beneath the stars
In the shadow, a diva rises

[Chorus - Quanta Beat]
Dance with the future, feel the heat
Quanta diva, move your feet
Ahhhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus - Electric Flow]
Glow in the neon, heartbeats collide
Every step, a story untold

[Bridge - Virtual Groove]
Lost in the sound, time stands still
Energy flows, a timeless thrill
woooooo

[outro - Digital Fade]
Quanta diva, dance away
Into the night, we sway
ooooo iiiiii
