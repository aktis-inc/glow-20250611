lyrics = [intro - Twilight Glow]
oooooo   
[gentle whispers]  
iiiiiiiiiiiiii

[verse - Ancient Melodies]  
Through the veils of time, echoes call  
Mystic rhythms, heartbeats align  
Beneath the starlit sky, we wander  
In shadows, whispers intertwine  
aaaaaa

[Chorus - Echoes of the Past]  
ooooo  
eeeeee  
Voices rise in sacred dance  
Chanting dreams, lost in trance

[Bridge - Spirits' Call]  
The wind carries tales untold  
In the silence, secrets unfold  
ahhhhhh  

[outro - Fade to Umbra]  
iiiiiiii  
oooooo
