The dhol beats echo in the night
Colors dance with electric light
iii ooo aaa

[chorus - cultural fusion]
In every heart, the rhythm swells
Past and future, where the spirit dwells
oooooo

[bridge - tradition meets modern]
Ancient tales in modern guise
Stories told beneath the skies
zzzzz

[outro - pulse fade]
The beat lingers, in memory's hold
Tradition and future, a story retold]
