[verse]

Soft whispers of the night  
A gentle breeze carries tales  
Underneath the cosmic light  
Flute and strings weave their veil

[chorus]

oooooo  
iiiiiii  
Melodies that touch the soul  
In harmony, we become whole

[bridge]

Sitar sings with ancient grace  
Tabla echoes in the space  
River flow, dreams embrace  
Mystical and calm, our place

[outro]

oooooo  
iiiiiii  
Whispers fade into the night  
Carried by the starlit light
