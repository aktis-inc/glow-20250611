lyrics = [intro - Soft Glow]
[whispered echo] dreaming high, reaching sky  
oooooo iiiiiiiii

[verse 1 - Gentle Rise]  
In the silence, a spark ignites  
Tender notes, heart takes flight  
zzzzzzhhhhh aaaa  
Melody whispers tales untold

[Pre-Chorus - Building Hope]  
[soft build-up]  
ooooo  
A voice so pure, with dreams to chase  
Innocence and strength embrace

[Chorus - Rheme's Echo]  
wooooooo  
iiiiii  
Singing through the night, stars align  
A journey unfolds, divine

[Bridge - Crescendo]  
Vibrant lights and shadows dance  
In the moment, take a chance  
Ahhhh shhhhh

[verse 2]  
Notes of wonder, echo clear  
In the heart, no trace of fear  
Dreams awaken, paths untold

[outro - Heartfelt Whisper]  
shhhhhh ooooo  
[gentle fade]  
In the silence, echoes remain  
Rheme's voice, a timeless refrain
