lyrics = [intro - Epic Rise]
woooooaaaahhh  
[verse 1 - Wings Unfurled]  
In the dawn's embrace, I take my flight  
Through realms of steel and light  
Guitar strings weave tales untold  
In this sky, my spirit bold  

[chorus - Ascendancy]  
ooooooo  
Galvyn soars on wings of fire  
Ever higher, never tire  
Through echoes of eternity  
A guardian of destiny  

[guitar solo - Celestial Dance]  
iiiiiiii  

[verse 2 - Horizon's Call]  
Onward through the storm I ride  
With dreams of stars to guide  
Orchestral waves crash and rise  
In this symphonic paradise  

[bridge - Hero's Oath]  
Sworn to the light, I’ll never fall  
In the heart of the storm, I hear the call  
aaaaahhhhhhhh  

[outro - Galvyn's Flight]  
ooooo  
Into the night, beyond the sight  
Galvyn's journey, eternal light  
woooooo  
aaaaaa
