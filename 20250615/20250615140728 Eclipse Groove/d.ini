[verse - rhythm ignition]  
Eclipse of sound, tradition meets the beat  
Rhythms collide, footsteps of the street  
ahhhhhh ooooo

Dance in the shadows, lights that speak

Voices echo in the neon streak

Ancient whispers, future's call  
Vibrant colors, rise and fall

Timeless melodies, no end

Dance floor fades, echoes remain  
Eclipse groove, in a vibrant refrain
