[verse]
Gently whispering shadows
In the night they dance
oooooooooooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

[chorus – Ethereal Echo]
Softly calling, dreams unfold
Through the mist, stories told  
oooooo

[bridge – Whispering Winds]
Embrace the night, feel the glow
Tales of phantoms, softly flow  
[echoing chime]

[outro – Fade to Dream]
oooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiaaaa  
Gentle breeze, fading light
