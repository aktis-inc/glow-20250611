[verse 1]
oooooo iiiii
In the moonlit whispers, tales unfold
Hearts in sync, like rivers flow
zzzzzz

[chorus]
Raanjhan echoes, through the night
Soul's embrace, stars alight
oooo iiiii

[verse 2]
Beneath the starlit canopy
Dreams dance in harmony
ooooo iii

[bridge]
Intertwined, like vines we grow
Eternal bond, love's gentle glow
shhhhhh

[outro]
Melodies fade, yet linger on
In the heart, love's eternal song
oooooo iiiii]
