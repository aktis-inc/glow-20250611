lyrics = [intro - gentle wave]

[verse 1]
In shadows of the past, they find
A tune that wraps their hearts in time
ooooooo iiiii

[Pre-Chorus - Nostalgic Hues]  
Soft gazes meet, in rhythm they sway
Every note a thread, weaving yesterday

[Chorus - Timeless Dance]  
ooooo wooooo
iiiiiii aaaaa
Hearts in sync, memories ignite

[Bridge - Dreamy Interlude]
Flute whispers tales, tabla beats entwine
Love‚Äôs old refrain, forever it shines
aaaaaaa

[verse 2]
Echoes linger in the twilight‚Äôs glow
Their story sings where the rivers flow

[outro - Fading Echo]
The waver fades, but love‚Äôs melody remains
ooooo iiiii
