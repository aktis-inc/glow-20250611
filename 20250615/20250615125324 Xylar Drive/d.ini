[verse - Journey Begins]  
Rolling through the night, lights blur past  
Traditions whisper, memories last  
ooooo

[instrumental - Cultural Fusion]  
(drumming beat)  
(soft flute melody)  

[Pre-Chorus - Urban Heartbeat]  
City's rhythm, ancient song  
Together they rise, where we belong  
iiiiiiiiii

[Chorus - Vibrant Dance]  
wooooo  
Dance of the ages, a timeless trance  

[Bridge - Echoes of the Past]  
In the heart of the city, where stories weave  
Ancient echoes, in the air we breathe  
ahhhh

[verse - Road Ahead]  
New dawn rising, paths untold  
Where dreams and history unfold  
zzzzzz

[outro - Fading Light]  
The road stretches on, whispers remain  
A journey through time, in a vibrant frame  
ooooo ii iiiiii
