[verse]
In the city's gentle hum
Dreams drift with the evening sun
oooooo

[chorus - whispered nostalgia]
Yara's song, a memory spun
Through streets where the echoes run
ahhhhhh

[bridge - soft glow]
Lights dance in the twilight zone
Whispers of what we've known
iiiiii

[outro - fading echoes]
Dusk settles, the city's sigh
In Yara's vibe, dreams never die
