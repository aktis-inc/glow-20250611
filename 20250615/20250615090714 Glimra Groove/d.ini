[verse]
ooooooo  
Dance with the stars,
Through the night’s embrace,
Rhythms align,
In the warm glow of space.

[build-up]
oooo aaaa  
Percussion whispers,
Echoes in the air,
Marimba guides,
In a world without care.

[chorus]
Glimra, glide,
Feel the pulse inside,
Every step, every beat,
Where the night takes flight.

[bridge]
oooo iiiii  
Basslines flow,
Underneath the sky,
Melodies soar,
As the moments fly.

[outro]
Dance and sway,  
In the Glimra way,
ooooooo  
iiiiii
