[verse]
Soft winds carry stories untold
Gentle light dances with shadows
ooooooo

[chorus]
Whispers of Oberon, in the night
Floating softly, dreams take flight
aaahhhhh

Stars align in quiet grace
Reflections shimmer, time slows its pace
iiiiiiii

Serene echoes fade to silence
Softly, the world breathes in awe
