lyrics = [intro - Neon Pulse]
whispered echoes  
shimmering lights  
[verse - Electric Dream]  
In shadows we find  
A voice, a sign  
oooooo  
[Pre-Chorus - Lucid Drift]  
floating through  
the city's hue  
[Chorus - Seraph's Whisper]  
woooooo  
ethereal glow  
[Bridge - Echoes of Light]  
Softly, we glide  
Through whispers and tides  
shhhhhh  
[Drop - Pulse Reverie]  
iiiiiii  
[Outro - Fading Glow]  
neon dreams fade  
into the shade
