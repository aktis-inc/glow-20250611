oooooo aaaaaa

[verse 1 - Wanderer's Tale]
In the fields where dreams take flight
Ektara sings, weaving night
A journey unfolds, unseen light
Vireo's call, echoes in sight
oooooo iiiiiiii

[Chorus - Soul's Dance]
Dance with the stars, in endless skies
Heart's whispers, where freedom lies
iiiiiiiii

[Bridge - Mystic Path]
Through shadows and sunlit glades
The wanderer's song never fades
ooooo aaaaa

[outro - Whispering Wind]
Vireo's echoes, soft and kind
In every heart, a tale to find
oooooo iiiiiiii
