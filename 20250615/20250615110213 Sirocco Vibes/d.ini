lyrics = [intro - mellow ambiance]

[verse 1]
Lost in the city, lights like stars
Time moves slow, heart beats fast
iiii oooooo
Dreams linger, past shadows cast

[chorus]
Sirocco winds, whispers of time
Flowing through streets, subtle and fine
ooooo iiiiii

[bridge - jazzy interlude]
Keys dance, saxophone hums
Life unfolds, rhythm drums
shhhhh ooooo

[outro - gentle fade]
Sirocco fades, night descends
Melodies linger, journey ends
zzzz oooo]
