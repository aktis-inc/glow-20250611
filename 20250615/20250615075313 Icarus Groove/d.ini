ooooo

[verse 1 - Rising]
Skyline whispers, in neon hues
Tradition dances, within the pulse
iiiiiii

[Pre-Chorus - Echoes]
ooooo
Rhythms collide, in vibrant glow
Fusion of worlds, in every beat

[Chorus - Flight]
woooooo
Fly high, like Icarus
Dance through dreams, with open wings

[Bridge - Fusion]
Tradition's voice, in urban nights
Dhol and tumbi, light the fire
Ahhhhh oooooo

[verse 2]
City's heart, beats with the past
Future's call, in every note
zzzzzz

[Outro - Groove]
shhhhh
Dance to the echo, of Icarus' flight
oooooo iiiii]
