lyrics = [intro - city whispers]

[verse 1]
Golden arches, whispers in the breeze
A dance of light, old meets new

[bridge - cultural dance]
rhythmic echoes, past and present entwined

[chorus]
oooo Virella, harmony in the air
iiii melodies weave dreams

[verse 2]
Footsteps echo through the bustling streets
Stories told in every glance

[drop - vibrant pulse]
shhhhhh ooooooo

[pre-chorus - rising tempo]
A world of colors, vibrant and alive
oooooo iiiii

[outro - sunset fade]
Harmony fades as night descends
