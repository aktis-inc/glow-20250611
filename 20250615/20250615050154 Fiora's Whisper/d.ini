lyrics = [intro - Ethereal Echoes]

[verse 1 - Wind's Tale]
In silent skies, a heart takes flight
Whispers of the unseen night
oooooh iiiiiii

[Pre-Chorus - Mystic Paths]
Gentle breeze, stories untold
Ancient rhythms, futures unfold
aaaaaaah

[Chorus - Fiora's Whisper]
Feel the pulse of time's embrace
Melodies dance in sacred space
iiiiiiiii oooooo

[Bridge - Timeless Dance]
Through shadows, a journey we make
In echoes, past dreams awake

[outro - Whisper's Fade]
Softly fading, like a distant call
Fiora sings, where dreams fall
oooo aaaaaa]
