[verse - Twilight Murmurs]  
In the city's glow, dreams unfold  
Beneath the sky, secrets untold  

[bridge - Horizon's Echo]  
oooooo  
iiiiii  
Whispers of time, gentle and slow

[chorus - Serenade to Stars]  
ahhhhhhhh  
ooooohhh  
Embrace the night, let your spirit flow  

[outro - Echoes Fade]  
Silent echoes, drifting away  
Into the calm of the ending day
