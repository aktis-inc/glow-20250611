lyrics = [intro - gentle river]
woooooo

[verse 1 - Whisper of Memories]
In the water, dreams unfold
Echoes of time, stories told

[Pre-Chorus - Nostalgic Breeze]
oooooo
Whispers of the past, gentle sway
In the heart, they softly play

[Chorus - Reflections Dance]
iiiiiiiiii
Memories twirl, in the night
Under stars, they take flight

[Bridge - Ethereal Flow]
River flows, carrying dreams
Silent tales, in moonbeams

[verse 2 - Soulful Echo]
Feel the warmth, in the breeze
Ancient tunes, among the trees

[outro - fading whispers]
aaaaaaa
Through the night, they softly call
In the heart, they linger, enthrall
