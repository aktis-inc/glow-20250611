[verse 1 - Moonlit Echoes]
Silhouettes dance in lunar glow
Whispers of a distant shore
Beneath the stars, dreams unfold
ahhhhh iiiiiii

[chorus - Celestial Harmony]
oooooo
In the night, we find our place
Melodies of time and space
oooooo

[bridge - Echoing Dreams]
Floating on a sea of stars
Embracing all that we are
shhhhhh oooooo

[outro - Cadenza Nocturne]
Whispers fade into the dawn
Harmony of night, reborn
oooo iiiiiiii
