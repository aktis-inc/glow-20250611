lyrics = [intro - soft whispers]

[piano intro]
iiiii oooooo

[verse 1 – Heart's Echo]
In the shadowed light, hearts awake
Wandering dreams, paths untold
Whispered stories, silent embrace
Kairo's call, a tale unfolds

[Chorus – Whispering Breeze]
ooooo
iiiiiiii
Deep within, the heart's refrain
Kairo whispers, love's sweet pain

[Bridge - Twilight Glow]
Stars align, in the night sky
Journey's end, where dreams fly
ahhhh
mmmmmmmm

[verse 2 – Soul's Yearning]
Footsteps trace, the river's song
Echoes linger, where we belong
Silent tears, in the moon's glow
Kairo's warmth, we softly know

[outro - Fading Light]
Softly, softly, night descends
Kairo's whisper, never ends
