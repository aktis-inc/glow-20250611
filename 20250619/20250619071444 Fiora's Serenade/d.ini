lyrics = [intro - temple ambiance]

[verse 1]
Fiora's whispers, soft and true  
In the garden, where spirits renew  
oooooo aaaaa

[chorus]
Harmony in every breath  
Nature's song, transcending death  
sitar strums, tabla beats  
iiii ooooo

[bridge]
Whispers of ancient lore  
Guiding through the temple door  
Fiora's light, evermore  
shhhhhh

[outro - peaceful retreat]
Serenade of time's embrace  
Echoes in this sacred space  
aaaaa iiiiiiii
