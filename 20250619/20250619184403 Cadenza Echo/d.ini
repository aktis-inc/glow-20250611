lyrics = [intro - Whispering Echoes]

[verse 1]
In silent halls, where echoes rest
A melody calls, through violin's chest
ooooooo
iiiiiiii

[bridge - Heart's Whispers]
Beneath the stars, in gentle sway
Dreams unfold, in the night's ballet

[chorus - Cadenza Soar]
wooooooo
Cadenza's song, in the heart's core
iiiiiiiiii

[verse 2]
Notes that dance, like fleeting light
In this embrace, day turns to night

[outro - Echo's Fade]
[soft violin solo]
