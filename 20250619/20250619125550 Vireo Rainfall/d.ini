lyrics = [intro]
(piano softly begins) iiiii oooooo

[verse 1 - Rain's Whisper]
In the silence, raindrops speak
Heartbeats echo, moments seek
Words unspoken, softly shared
Underneath the skies, we dared

[Pre-Chorus - Gentle Tides]
ooooo iiiii
Whispers dance, with every tear
Promises made, crystal clear

[Chorus - Embrace]
In this rainfall, love's refrain
Hearts entwined, in gentle rain
oooooo
iiiii

[Bridge - Soul's Echo]
Together we stand, in the storm's embrace
Every drop a memory, a timeless trace
Ahhhh shhhhhh

[verse 2 - Heartfelt Promises]
Steps on wet stones, paths we tread
Underneath the clouds, dreams are fed
Love's a journey, softly we tread

[glitch build-up]
ssshhhh oooo

[outro - Vireo Rainfall]
(whispered echo)
In the rain, our spirits soar
Forevermore, forevermore iiiii oooooo
