oooooooooo

[verse 1 - Whispering Traditions]  
Beneath the ancient skies  
Melodies weave through time  
Heartbeats echo, soft as silk

[Chorus - Rivara's Call]  
iiiiiiii  
Harmony within the soul  
Reverie of ages, untold

[Bridge - Flow of Seasons]  
Gentle as the river's flow  
Stories of old, softly glow  
ahhhhhh

[verse 2 - Modern Pulse]  
In the dance of shadow and light  
Tradition and modern unite  
Waves of sound, cascading bright

[glitch build-up]  
sssshhh ooooo

[outro - Fading Echoes]  
iiiiii ooooo  
Whispers fade, yet linger on
