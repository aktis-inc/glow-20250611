lyrics = [intro - gentle rise]

[verse 1 - Whispered Praise]
In the quiet, hearts awaken  
Guided by a gentle light  
oooo aaaah  

[Pre-Chorus - Echoing Faith]
Soft whispers of grace  
Every note a gentle embrace  
iiii ooo  

[Chorus - Celestial Chorus]
Lifted voices, soaring high  
Grateful hearts, we testify  

[Bridge - Sacred Moment]
In the stillness, we find our way  
Songs of hope in the break of day  
oooo aaaa  

[verse 2 - Silent Reverence]
Silent prayers, softly spoken  
Healing words, unbroken  
zzzzz hhhh  

[outro - Peaceful Fade]
ooooo iiiii  
[soft echo]
