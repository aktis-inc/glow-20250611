lyrics = [intro - Echoes]
(Soft synth hum) Shadows dance in silence
(Soft synth hum) Dreams lost to the void
oooooooooooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

[verse 1 – Fading Light]
In the mirror's gaze, I see the past
Every scar, a story left unheard
Whispered secrets echo through the night
Life's a canvas of forgotten hues
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Hope's Whisper]  
[soft glitch]
oooooooooo
A glimpse of light in the distance
A heartbeat away from surrender

[Chorus – Cadenza of Shadows]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Solitude's Edge] 
Standing on the cliff of memories
Waves crash against forgotten dreams
Ahhhhhh shhhh  
[echoed sigh]

[verse 2]
Lost in the maze of time and tears
Each step echoes in the emptiness
Too alive to fade away

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[distorted whisper] life... hope... shadows... (oh-yeah!)

[outro - Cadenza of Shadows]
