[verse - Echoed Steps]  
Beneath the moon’s tender gaze  
Lanterns drift into the haze  
oooooo   
iiiiiii   

[chorus - Soul’s Embrace]  
Dance with the shadows and light  
Feel the earth’s gentle might  
oo aaaa   

[verse - Whispered Winds]  
Rhythms weave through the night  
Stars sing, dreams take flight  
zzzzzzhhhhh   

[bridge - Ethereal Call]  
Voices rise with the dawn  
Echoes of what is gone  
shhhhhh ooohhhh   

[outro - Umber Reverie]  
The world spins in harmony  
Within the heart’s symphony  
oooo ooooo]
