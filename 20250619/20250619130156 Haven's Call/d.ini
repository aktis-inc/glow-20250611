[gentle flute]

[verse 1 – Whisper of the Leaves]
Softly flows the river's song
In the heart of ancient woods
Where whispers carry on

[Chorus – Haven's Call]
ooooo iiiii
Harmony in nature's breath
Echoes of the earth beneath

[Bridge - Twilight Glow]
Mmmmm aaaaa
Twilight dances on the stream
Dreams weave in the gentle breeze

[outro]
[flute and nature sounds]
