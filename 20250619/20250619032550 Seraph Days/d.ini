[verse 1 - Urban Pulse]
Shadows breathe in neon light  
Time slips through the cracks  
mmmmmmm ooooooo  
iiiii

[chorus - Seraph's Call]
City's heart beats slow  
Whispers echo low  
oooooo

[bridge - Twilight Dance]
Ghosts of yesterday  
Dancing through the haze  
shhhhhh  

[outro - Fade to Night]
Silence wraps the streets  
Seraph's lullaby  
ooooooo iiiiiii]
