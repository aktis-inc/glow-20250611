[verse]
Gentle whispers in the night
Hearts entwined in moonlit glow
iiiiiiiaaaaaaaa

[chorus]
Hold me close, donâ€™t let go
Dreams we weave, soft and slow
ooooooohhhhh

[bridge]
Stars above, silent vow
In this moment, here and now
ssshhhhhh

[verse 2]
Soft as shadows, gentle light
Love in umber, endless flight
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[outro - fading whispers]
