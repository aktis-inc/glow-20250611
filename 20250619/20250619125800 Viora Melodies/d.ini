lyrics = [intro - Vintage Whirl]
ssssssssss  
[Playful Tune]  
Brass sings, echoing past  
ooooo  
Footsteps dance, laughter spills  
iiiiiiii

[verse - Whimsical Notes]  
Colors swirl, melodies play  
Nostalgia hums, heartstrings sway  
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Chorus - Harmonious Echo]  
la la la laaa  
Viora, in vibrant glow  
Every note, a gentle throw  

[Bridge - Melodic Twist]  
Joyful tones, memories weave  
In this tune, we all believe  
Ahhhhhh shhhhhhh  
[echoed laughter]

[verse 2 - Brass and Woodwind]  
Songs of old, new again  
In the rhythm, we pretend  
Life's a show, never ends

[outro - Viora Melodies]  
ssshhhh oooo  
[fade with gentle hum]
