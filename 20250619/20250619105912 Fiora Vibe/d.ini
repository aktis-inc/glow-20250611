    ooooo  
    iiiiiii

    [verse 1 - Urban Flow]  
    Lights flicker, shadows play  
    Heartbeat echoes through the sway  
    City whispers, night’s embrace  

    [Pre-Chorus - Neon Dreams]  
    ooooo  
    In the glow of endless streams  
    Every moment feels extreme  

    [Chorus - Fiora Vibe]  
    oooo  
    Feel the rhythm, take the dive  
    In this moment, we’re alive  

    [Bridge - Electric Echo]  
    Streets alive, time unfolds  
    Stories told in shades of gold  
    iiiiiiii

    [verse 2 - Midnight Hues]  
    Dreams ignite in vibrant hues  
    Every step, a dance we choose  
    Night reveals its hidden muse  

    [outro - Vibe Fade]  
    ooooo  
    iiiiii  
    City’s heart slows, echoes fade
