[guitar riff]

[verse 1 - Ignition]
The night is alive, with a spark in the air  
Drums echo, guitars wailing loud  
iiiiiiiiiiii

[Chorus - Inara's Call]
oooooo  
Feel the resonance, the pulse of the crowd  
Hearts collide, in the sound  

[verse 2 - Electric Surge]
Lights explode, shadows dance in the glow  
Voices rise, the anthem calls  
oooooo iiiiii

[bridge - Sonic Wave]
Ride the wave, let it take you high  
Grit and grace, in every cry  
aaaaa zzzzz

[Chorus - Inara's Call]
oooooo  
Feel the resonance, the pulse of the crowd  
Hearts collide, in the sound  

[outro - Fade to Echo]
The night fades, but the memory stays  
Inara's song, in the echoing haze  
iiiiiii oooooo
