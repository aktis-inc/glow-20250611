lyrics = [intro - Glitch Bloom]
zzzzzzzttt
(Synth voice) Signal lock... location found...

[verse 1 - Frequency Shift]
Static on the line, a whisper in the void
Tracing phantom maps, nowhere to be destroyed
The coordinates are blurred, a destination lost

[Pre-Chorus - Build Up]
ahhhh-ahhhh
Pulse aligns with the unknown cost

[Chorus - Electric Surge]
ooooooooooooo
This is the current flow
Our Haven starts to grow
iii iiiiiii

[Drop - Power On]
[heavy bass drop]
(Echoing) Haven... Haven...

[verse 2 - Neon Glow]
City lights bleed out, a digital sea
Every shadow holds a new decree
Lost in the feedback loop, finding my own way

[Pre-Chorus - Build Up]
ahhhh-ahhhh
Breaking free from yesterday

[Chorus - Electric Surge]
ooooooooooooo
This is the current flow
Our Haven starts to grow
iii iiiiiii

[Bridge - Circuit Dream]
We built it piece by piece, a refuge in the sound
On fractured frequencies, solid ground
ahhhhhhhh

[Drop - Final Pulse]
[intense synth burst]
(Distorted) Electric... Haven...

[outro - Fade to Hum]
[glitch fade]
(Synth voice) Connection lost... trace dissolved...
mmmmmmmmmm
