lyrics = [intro]
(guitar strumming softly)  
[verse]  
Dusty roads and tales untold  
Life's a game, so brave and bold  
Winds of change, whispers low  
In the night, truths unfold  
ooooo iiiiii  
[chorus]  
Feel the gamble, life's own dance  
Every choice, another chance  
ooooo  
[bridge]  
Cards are dealt, the stakes are high  
In the shadows, dreams can fly  
[verse]  
Lessons learned under starlit sky  
With the wind, we drift and sigh  
[chorus]  
Feel the gamble, life's own dance  
Every choice, another chance  
[outro]  
(soft harmonica fades)  
wooooo iiiiii
