lyrics = [intro - Whispering Zephyr]
ooooo  
iiiii  

[verse 1]  
Soft echoes of a distant past  
Gentle winds carry whispers of longing  
Through the silence, hearts entwine  
In the shadows, love's light shines  

[Pre-Chorus - Velvet Tide]  
ooooo  
iiiiii  
Silent dreams meet the gentle sea  
Where time is lost and hearts are free  

[Chorus - Eternal Embrace]  
wooooo  
iiiiiiii  
Hold me close, in the zephyr's breeze  
Love’s embrace, like the endless seas  

[Bridge - Moonlit Dance]  
In the moonlight, shadows waltz  
Every step a timeless dance  
Beneath the stars, our stories blend  
In this moment, love transcends  

[outro - Whispering Zephyr]  
ooooo  
iiiii  
Let the zephyr carry our song  
In its whispers, we belong
