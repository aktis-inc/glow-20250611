lyrics = [intro echo]
(soft whisper) life feels heavy, shadows long  
(soft whisper) dreams fade in the night  
ooooo  
iiiiiiiiiii

[verse 1 – Quiet Lament]  
In the stillness, whispers hold  
Memories like ghosts, cold  
Shadows dance, stories untold  
Blen carries weight, stories fold  
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Echoed Grief]  
[soft echo]  
ooooooo  
In the silence, echoes cry  
Every heartbeat, a goodbye  

[Chorus – Silent Descent]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Sorrow's Edge]  
I'm a shadow in my own tale  
Walking paths where echoes wail  
Ahhhhhh shhhhhh  
[echoed sigh]

[verse 2]  
Life unwinds, thread by thread  
Songs unsung, words unsaid  
In the night, alone I tread

[outro - Blen Shadows]
