[verse]

Golden threads of sound  
Whisper through timeless air  
In the heart of peace

[chorus]

ooooo

Beyond the horizon's edge  
A dance of light unfolds  
Ancient echoes call

[drop]

ahhhh aaaaaa

[verse]

Waves of joy in rhythm flow  
Carrying dreams of old  
In every note, a story told

[outro - Svara Serenity]
