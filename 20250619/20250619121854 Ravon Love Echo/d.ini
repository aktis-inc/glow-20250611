lyrics = [intro - gentle waves]

[verse 1 - Soft Whispers]
On this shore, where dreams unfold
Echos linger, stories untold
iiiii aaaaa

[Pre-Chorus - Heart's Call]
oooooo
In the silence, love finds voice
Every heartbeat, a gentle choice

[Chorus - Ravon Embrace]
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Echo's Dance]
Eyes meet, hearts align (in time)
Steps in rhythm, love's design
ahhhh mmmmm  

[verse 2 - Tender Moments]
Seasons pass, but we remain
In this dance, love's gentle rain

[outro - Fading Light]
ooooo
Love's echo, soft and bright
Ravon whispers through the night
