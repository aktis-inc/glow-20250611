lyrics = [intro synth hum]

[verse 1]
Shadows fall, lights ignite
In the city's embrace, we find our night
ooooo iiiii

[pre-chorus]
Hidden whispers, echoing through
In the rhythm, we see the truth

[chorus]
wooo ooooo
Serein shadows glide
In the electric tide

[bridge]
Between the beats, secrets lie
In the pulse, we touch the sky
ahhhhh

[verse 2]
Neon dreams, under our skin
In this dance, we begin

[outro - fading echoes]
Shadows fade, but the night remains
In our hearts, the city's refrain
