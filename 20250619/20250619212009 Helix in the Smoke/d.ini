woooo

[verse 1 - Neon Mirage]  
In the city’s heart, where shadows play  
Echoes of dreams, in neon sway  
Grit beneath my feet, stories untold  
In the smoke, secrets unfold

[Pre-Chorus - Vortex Pulse]  
oooooo  
hhhhhhh

[Chorus - Helix Unraveled]  
In the haze, we find our way  
Through the night, led astray  
Helix spins, in rhythmic flight  
Beyond the dark, into the light

[Bridge - Smoke's Embrace]  
Whispers in the alleys, lost and found  
In the dance of light, we’re unbound  
iiiiiiiiii

[verse 2 - Echoed Streets]  
Footsteps echo, a fading trace  
In the city's maze, we embrace  
Stories of old, in every breath  
In the helix, life and death

[drop - Final Descent]  
ssshhhhhh  
oooooo

[outro - Fade into Dawn]  
As the smoke clears, night retreats  
Helix spins, in endless beats  
oooooo
