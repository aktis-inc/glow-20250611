[verse 1]
Soft whispers in the night
Under silvery light, dreams take flight
oooooo

[chorus - heartfelt]
In the heart's embrace, love finds its place
ooooo iiiii aaaaa

[bridge - moonlit reverie]
Gentle winds, secrets unfold
In the silence, our stories told
shhhhhh

[outro - fading light]
Hearts entwined, whispers fade
Under stars, memories cascade
oooo iiiii]
