lyrics = [intro - Gleam Vibe]

(Chorus – Harmonious Echo)
Dancing through the echoes, where stories unfold
oooooooooooo  
iiiiiii

[verse 1 – Nostalgic Pulse]
In the haze of neon lights, we find our glow
Melodies ride the breeze, whispers of the past
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Pre-Chorus – Retro Surge]  
[soft synth build-up]
oooooooooo
Every note a memory, every beat a smile

[Chorus – Harmonious Echo]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiiiiii

[Bridge - Vibrant Horizon] 
We paint the sky with sound, colors of our youth
Ahhhhhhh shshshshsh  
[echoed laughter]

[verse 2]
In the rhythm of time, we weave our dreams
Chasing the light, where the heartbeats meet

[outro - Gleam Record]
ooooooo iiiiiiiiii iiiiiiiiii
