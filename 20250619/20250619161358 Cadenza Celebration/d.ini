[sitar intro] 
ooooo
iiiii

[verse 1 - Joyful Gathering]
In the heart of the night, stars align
Echoes of laughter, rhythms entwine
Dance of the ages, in timeless embrace
iiiiii
oooooo

[Chorus - Celebration Pulse]
Cadence of joy, hearts in flight
Under the moon, spirits light

[Bridge - Harmonious Flow]
Sitar sings with the wind, tabla echoes the beat
In celebration, tradition and modernity meet
ahhhh

Colors of life paint the sky
Where dreams and reality fly
Harmony whispers in every breath
iiiiii
oooooo

[outro - Festival Twilight]
As the night fades, the spirit remains
Cadenza celebration, in every heart it sustains
oooo
ahhhhhh
