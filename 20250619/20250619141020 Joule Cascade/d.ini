lyrics = [intro]

[ambient echo]

[verse 1 – Whispered Paths]
In shadows, echoes dance
Thoughts ripple through the haze
Floating on a breeze unseen
Layers unravel, secrets reveal

[chorus – Ethereal Waves]
oooooo  
iiiiiii  
jovial echoes guide my way

[bridge – Reflective Light]
Steps on clouds, a gentle trace
In the quiet, find my place
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[verse 2 – Hidden Depths]
Winding roads of lingering dreams
Reflections in the streaming beams
Lost in time, yet feeling free

[outro – Fading Glow]
oooooo  
iiiiiii  
13
[intro]
(voix lointaine)
Un souffle... dans le vide...

[verse 1 - Fractures]
Les murs tombent (lentement)
Sous le poids d'un rêve
iiiiiiiii
ooooooooo

[Pre-Chorus - Build]
[synth pulse]
Une lueur (faible)
Dans le chaos

[Chorus - Cascade]
wooooosh
aaaaaaahhh
La chute (dorée)
De tout ce qui fut

[verse 2 - Rebirth]
L'ombre danse (avec le vent)
Un nouveau regard
zzzzzzzz
chhh

[Bridge - Glitch Fade]
[distorted whisper] oubli... souvenir... Joule...
[glitch effect]

[Outro - Dissipation]
[atmospheric drone]
(voix étouffée) Cascade... Cascade...
