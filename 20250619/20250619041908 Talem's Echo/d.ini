lyrics = [intro – Whispered Echoes]

[verse 1]
In the silent room, shadows fall  
Memories whisper, in the corners they call  
oooooo iiiiiii

[chorus – Heart's Lament]
Your name, a song I can't unsing  
Every note a gentle sting  
aaaaaaaa  

[bridge – Twilight Tears]
Between the dreams and the dawn  
Our love, a fading song  
shhhhhhh  

[verse 2]
Time moves slow in this void  
Emotions once shared, now destroyed  
zzzzzzhhh  

[outro – Fading Light]
Echoes fade into the night  
In the silence, I find light  
oooo iiiiiii
