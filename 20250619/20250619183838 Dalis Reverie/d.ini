[verse - Whisper of Strings]  
In twilight's arms, we find our way  
Echoes of the past guide us softly  
oooooo

In the stillness, dreams unfold  
Harmony sings, stories untold

Gentle winds, carry our song  
Through the night, where we belong

oooooo  
With each note, we find our peace  
A soulful journey's sweet release
