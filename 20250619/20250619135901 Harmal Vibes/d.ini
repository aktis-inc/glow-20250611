(soft chant) iiiiiii  
(soft chant) ooooooo  

[verse 1 – Celestial Path]  
Whispers of the universe, through ancient hymns  
Eternal dance of stars, in rhythm with heartbeats  
oooooo  
Harmal guides, in cosmic embrace  

[Pre-Chorus – Divine Echo]  
[soft flute]  
ooooooo  
Harmony in silence, echoes of the soul  

[Chorus – Harmal Vibes]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiiii  

[Bridge - Sacred Union]  
Chants of devotion, bind us to the stars  
In Harmal’s light, we find our path  
ahhhhh  

[verse 2 – Eternal Light]  
Stars align, in cosmic symphony  
Guided by chants, through celestial waves  
zzzzzzhhhhhh  

[outro - Harmal Vibes]  
[soft chanting fade]  
oooooo iiiiiiii
