[verse]
In the garden of whispered dreams
Where hearts connect beyond the seams
oooooo

[chorus - Harmonious Flow]
Love dances with the breeze
Tender moments, eternal seas
iiiiiiiiiiii

[verse - Romantic Harmony]
Sitar's strings sing tales of old
Beneath the lantern's gentle hold
ssshhhh ooooo

[bridge - Ethereal Echo]
Stars above, guiding light
In embrace, we find our flight
ahhhhhh

[outro - Fading Serenade]
As night falls, love's serenade
In the garden, memories fade
ooooo aaaa]
