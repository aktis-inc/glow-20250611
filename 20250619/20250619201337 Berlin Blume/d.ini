[verse 1 - City Pulse]
In the night, lights flicker
Streets alive, whispers linger

Feel the beat, in the veins
Dance like stars, in the rain

[Bridge - Neon Flow]
Sisterhood and echoes
Viral steps, where time slows

[Pre-Chorus - Rise]
oooooo  
Together we move, feel the groove
Berlin nights, endless flight

[Drop - Dance Trend]

iiiiiiii  
Berlin Blume, in the groove

[outro - Fade]
Pulsing lights, fading glow
Dance ends, but never slow
