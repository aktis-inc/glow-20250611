lyrics = [intro – Neon Pulse]
(whispered echoes) berada di kota... malam...

[verse 1 – Luminous Path]  
Jalan bercahaya dalam ritme
Di bawah sinar bulan, kita berlari
ooooo  
ooooo

[Pre-Chorus – Electric Surge]  
woooo  
Bersama suara, kita melayang
Tinggi di atas mimpi

[Chorus – Virel Echoes]  
iiiiiiii  
Dalam gema, kita temukan cahaya
Melodi ini takkan pudar

[Bridge – Sonic Flight]  
Kita adalah suara yang tak terhenti
Terbang di atas kota yang bercahaya
ooooo  
ooooo

[verse 2 – Neon Dreams]  
Langkah kita seirama
Di antara bayangan, kita bersinar

[Drop – Soundwave Burst]  
sssshhhhh  
oooooo  
[Outro – Fading Lights]  
(cyber echoes) malam... berakhir...
