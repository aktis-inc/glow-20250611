lyrics = [intro - Whisper of Winds]
(soft synth)  
oooooo

[verse 1 - Heart's Call]  
Gale's breath whispers soft tunes  
In the silence, echoes bloom  
Feel the rhythm of the past  
Eternal moments meant to last

[Pre-Chorus - Emotional Rise]  
(soft piano)  
oooo  
gently swaying, heartbeats align  
whispered dreams intertwine

[Chorus - Gale's Echo]  
wooooo  
iiiiiii  
Listen close, the heart's decree  
In the wind, find clarity

[Bridge - Soul's Reflection]  
Gentle touch, time's embrace  
In the gale, find your place  
ahhhhhh  
shhhhhh 

[verse 2]  
Memories dance in the breeze  
Each note brings gentle release  
Hold the echoes, don't let go  
In the heart, love's warmth will grow

[outro - Echo Fade]  
(soft guitar)  
ooooo  
iiiiiii  
whispering to the soul's core  
in the gale, forevermore
