lyrics = [intro mist]

[verse 1 – Neon Echo]
Silent streets, whispers in the glow
Fynor dreams, shadows come and go
sssshhhh ooooo

[Pre-Chorus – Pulse of Light]
Fading in the neon rain
Each step echoes in the lane
oooooo iiiiii

[Chorus – Enigmatic Dance]
Fynor vibes, heartbeat in the night
Whispered secrets, take flight
ooooo aaaa

[Bridge - Echoing Dreams]
In the mist, I find my way (oh)
Lost and found, night turns to day (yeah)
ahhhh shhhhhh

[verse 2]
Fynor’s light, leading through the haze
Guiding steps in a neon maze
ooooo iiiiii

[outro - Fade to Shadow]
Dreams unfold, in the city’s heart
Fynor whispers, a new start
shhhhh iiiii]
