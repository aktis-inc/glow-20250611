[verse]

Spirals in the night
Eternal dance of stars
oooo aaaa eeeeee

[chorus - Mystical Whirl]

iiiiiiiiii
Whirling through ancient echoes
Beneath the moonlit sky

[bridge - Celestial Flow]

Dreams unfold, whispers of the past
Across galaxies, our voices cast

[verse 2]

In the heart's stillness
Find the rhythm of life
oooo aaaa eeeeee

[outro - Dervish Whirl]

ooooo iiiii
A dance of the universe
Forever turning, forever free
