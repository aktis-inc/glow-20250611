[verse 1 – Echoes of Time]
Soft winds carry the tales  
Through the dance of notes and dreams  
Raven whispers ancient songs  

[chorus – Harmonious Flight]
oooooo  
iiiiii  
In the echoes, we find our path  

[instrumental interlude]
Sitar sings with the breeze  
Tabla beats like a heart  
A serene journey unfolds  

[verse 2 – River's Tale]
Flowing through the forest's heart  
Melodies weave the strands  
Of a world both new and old  

[outro – Raven's Echoes]
Soft whispers fade  
Into the night's embrace  
oooooooo  
iiiii
