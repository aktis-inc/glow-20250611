lyrics = [intro - Neon Whispers]
ooooo iiiii  
[echoing piano notes]

[verse 1 - Midnight Solitude]  
In twilight's embrace, thoughts collide  
Streets whisper secrets, shadows hide  
Oberon dreams in neon light  
A world alive in the quiet night  
sssshhhhh

[Pre-Chorus - Ethereal Pulse]  
Soar through the mist, unbound by time  
iiiiii oooooo  
Each heartbeat echoes a distant chime

[Chorus - Reverie Unfolding]  
woooooo  
In the city of dreams, I find my way  
Lost in echoes, come what may  
iiiiiii oooooo

[Bridge - Silent Reflections]  
Glimpse the stars in a puddle's sheen  
Life's a dance on a silver screen  
ooooo  
shhhhhhh  

[verse 2 - Introspective Journey]  
Past and future, a woven thread  
Memories linger, words unsaid  
Oberon's call in the silent night

[outro - Fading Echoes]  
Sssshhhh oooo  
The night sighs as dreams take flight
