[verse - Whispered Memories]
Rivers flow through ancient dreams  
Echoes of a forgotten song  
Harmony dances in the breeze  
A bridge between times, strong

[chorus - Eternal Blend]
Jovial harmony, souls intertwine  
Past and future in a single line  
oooooo aaaaa  
iiiiii  

[bridge - Rhythmic Union]
Tradition and innovation unite  
In melodies that take flight  
Ancient chords with modern grace  
Touch the heart in this space

[outro - Fade to Infinity]
oooooo iiiiii  
Whispers fade, yet remain  
In the echoes of the refrain
