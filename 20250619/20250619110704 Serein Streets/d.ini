lyrics = [intro - street echoes]

[verse 1 - Shadows Move]
City lights flicker, stories untold
Voices whisper, in the cold night air
oooooo

[chorus - Serein Pulse]
iiiiiii
Beat of the streets, life in the cracks
Echoes of dreams, never look back
oooo aaaa

[bridge - Dark Corners]
Footsteps echo, paths unknown
Serein guides, where shadows roam

[verse 2 - Gritty Beat]
Concrete jungle, secrets unfold
Rhythms of life, in the stories retold

[chorus - Serein Pulse]
woooooo
Beat of the streets, life in the cracks
Echoes of dreams, never look back

[outro - Fading Lights]
Serein whispers, through the night
City's heart beats, out of sight
oooo iiiiiii
