lyrics = [intro - City Awakening]
oooooo aaaaaaa
[market sounds]
[verse]
Colors swirl, in between the alleys  
Voices rise, echo through the air  
Mmmmmm
[Chorus - Soul's Call]
iiiiiiii yyyyyyy
Tradition dances with the present  
Heartbeat of the city  
[Bridge - Mistral Breeze]
Flowing through the streets  
Past and future meet  
[echoed breath]
[verse 2]
We walk the paths of old  
Stories untold, in the glow  
[glitch build-up]
oooooo iiiiii  
[outro - Echoes of the Mistral]
