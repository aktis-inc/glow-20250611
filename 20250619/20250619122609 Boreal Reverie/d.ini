[ethereal whispers]  
oooooo  
iiiiiiii

[verse - Tranquil Echoes]  
In whispers of the wind  
Ancient tales unfold  
Journey to the unseen  
In silence, we are whole  
aaaaahhhhhhh

[soft chorus]  
oooooooo  
iiiiiiiii

[bridge - Mystic Pathways]  
Floating on a dream  
Beyond the horizon's call  
In the Boreal reverie  
We find the truth of all  
ooooo

[outro - Gentle Descent]
