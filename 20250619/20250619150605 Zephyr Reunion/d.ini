lyrics = [intro - soft rise]
Piano's whisper, heartbeats align  
Gentle breeze in the night sky

[verse 1 - Pathways]  
Memories echo, roads we've crossed  
Guided by light, never lost  
oooooo  
iiiiiiii

[Pre-Chorus - Horizon Glow]  
Voices call through the golden haze  
Every step in a warm embrace  

[Chorus - Reunion Song]  
wooooooo  
Zephyr carries dreams anew  
In this moment, me and you  

[Bridge - Timeless Flow]  
Time bends, the past and present meet  
Heartfelt whispers, bittersweet  
ahhhhhh  
zzzzzz  

[verse 2 - Reflections]  
Every mile a silent vow  
Here and now, we find our sound  

[outro - gentle fade]  
Through the zephyr, dreams arise  
Reunion in the endless skies]
