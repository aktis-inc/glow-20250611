[verse]  
In the prysm light, echoes call  
Digital dreams, we rise and fall  
oooooo aaaaa  

[chorus]  
Pulsing through the night, we glide  
In this realm, we can't hide  
iiiiiiiii ooooooo  

[bridge]  
Neon waves, they guide our flight  
Through electric skies, we ignite  
ssshhhh zzzzzzz  

[outro - Prysm Vibe]
