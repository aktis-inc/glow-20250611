lyrics = [intro - Soft Glow]
wooo  
oooo  
iiiiiiii

[verse 1 – City of Dreams]  
In the shadows, whispers dance  
Hearts that meet in a fleeting glance  
ooooo  
Tender moments, silent vow  
Beneath the stars, time slows now  
sssssshhhh

[Chorus – Whispering Wynne]  
oooooo  
weeeeeee  
Lovers' tale in the night  
Echoes soft, hearts alight

[Bridge - Lantern Glow]  
Floating dreams, softly sway  
In the mist, love finds its way  
zzzzzzzz

[verse 2 – Eternal Embrace]  
Paths entwined, forever bound  
In each other, solace found  
iiiiiiii

[outro - Gentle Fade]  
oooooo  
weeeeeee  
Fading whispers, love remains  
In the echoes of our names]
