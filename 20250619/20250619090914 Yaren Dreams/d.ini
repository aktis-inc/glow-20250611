[verse 1 – Gentle Awakening]
Dawn's light in the serene eyes
Melodies weave through dreams
oooooo aaaahh

[chorus – Ethereal Dance]
Spirits rise, colors sway
In the rhythm of heartbeats
iiiiiiii aaaaaa

[bridge – Dreamscape Flow]
Flowing rivers of sound
Embrace the sky's embrace
shhhhh ooooo

[verse 2 – Whispering Breeze]
Echoes in the ancient halls
Stories untold, unfolding now
zzzzhhhhh iiiii

[outro - Yaren Dreams]
Fade into the soft horizon
Where the past meets tomorrow
