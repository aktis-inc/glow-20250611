mmmmmmmm  
oooooooooo  
Chants rise with the dawn  
Echoes of the ancient past  
In sacred air, we breathe

aaaaahhhhh  
iiiiiiiii  
Yara calls to the divine  
Hearts open wide  
In this serene space

Gentle steps on sacred ground  
Harmony in every sound  
Whispers of the soul

Softly, the light fades  
In peace, we rest  
Yara's devotion remains
