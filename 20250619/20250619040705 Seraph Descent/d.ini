lyrics = [intro - ethereal whispers]
(Soft echoes) Descent begins, light shimmers  
(Soft echoes) Rain falls like dreams  
oooooo  
iiiiiiiiiii  
  
[verse 1 – Neon Steps]  
Walk through echoes of time  
Every beat a memory  
Shadows dance in twilight  
I am the sound, I am the light  
zzzzzzhhhhhh  
  
[Pre-Chorus – Whispering Pulse]  
[soft glitch]  
oooooooooo  
Within the rhythm of the night  
Every whisper takes flight  
  
[Chorus – Electric Descent]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii oooooo  
  
[Bridge - Luminous Drift]  
I am the rain, I am the storm (descending)  
Journey through sound, through form (unending)  
Ahhhhhh shhshshsh  
[echoed breath]  
  
[verse 2]  
Trace the path of glowing lines  
The melody is my guide  
Too alive to be confined  
  
[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  
  
[distorted whisper] descent… rhythm… embrace… (oh-yeah!)  
  
[outro - Seraph Descent]
