[verse 1 – Echoes of Yalor]  
Whispering winds guide the way  
Rivers sing the ancient lore  
Beneath the moon's gentle sway  
Harmony opens the door  
aaaaa

[Chorus – Melodic Embrace]  
Yalor's echo, soft and true  
In every note, a dream anew  
oooooo  
ssssss

[Bridge – Serene Journey]  
Stars weave patterns in the sky  
Time lingers, moments fly  
In the heart's quiet sigh  
Eternal echoes never die  
oooooo

[outro – Harmonious Fade]  
iiiiiii  
softly, gently, Yalor's call  
loooooo  
eternal, peaceful, after all]
