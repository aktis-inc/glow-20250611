[verse 1 - Timeless Whisper]
In shadows of the past, melodies linger
Each note a whisper, a touch of gold
Hearts entwined in the rhythm of yesteryears
oooooo aaaaahiii

[Pre-Chorus - Echoes of Love]
Softly they call, the echoes of time
Strings and flutes weave their magic
iiiiiii aaaaaa

[Chorus - Soul's Symphony]
Tere bina, zindagi ka saaz
Lag ja gale, in this timeless dance
woooooo

[Bridge - Eternal Lullaby]
In every breath, a song of old
A gentle caress of memories untold
shhhhhh ooooo

[outro - Fading Reverie]
dharaaa dharaaa
[soft chorus fade]
