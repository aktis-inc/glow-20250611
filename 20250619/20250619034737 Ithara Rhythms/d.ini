[verse - Whispering Traditions]
In the heart of the city, echoes from the past  
Gentle winds carry tales, of love and dreams vast  
oooooo iiiii

[Chorus - Cultural Symphony]
ooooooo  
Melodies entwined, across time they glide  
In Ithara we find, the rhythm of our stride  
iiiiii oooooo

[Bridge - Future Meets Past]
Neon lights dance, with shadows of yore  
In this fusion of times, our spirits soar  
shhhhhh ahhhhhh  

[outro - Ithara Fade]
