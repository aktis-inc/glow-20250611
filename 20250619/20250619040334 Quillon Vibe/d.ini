ooooo aaaa

[verse - Ceremonial Echo]
In the dance of time, we find our place  
Chants weave stories in the air  
A tapestry of sound, beyond space

[Chorus - Harmony of Spirits]
iiiiiiiiii  
Vibrant echoes, heart's embrace  
Melodies guide, in sacred grace  
oooooo

[Bridge - Twilight's Reverence]  
Shadows dance with the light  
In the glow, all is right  
ooooo

[outro - Quillon's Journey]
Whispers of the past, future's glance  
In this moment, lost in trance  
aaaaa iiiiii
