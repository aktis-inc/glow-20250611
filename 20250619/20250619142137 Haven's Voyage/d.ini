lyrics = [intro - Ghostly Echo]
(whispered) iiiii ooooooo

[verse 1 - Sailor's Lament]
The sea knows tales untold
Whispers of the deep, cold
ooooooo
Waves crash, secrets unfold

[Chorus - Phantom Crew]
Heave ho, shadows in tow
ooooo iiiiiii
Sail through mist, where spirits flow

[Bridge - Fogbound]
Echoes in the night, eerie light
iii aaaa aaaa
Lost souls guide, through endless night

[verse 2 - Mariner's Call]
Beneath the waves, hidden graves
ooooo zzzzz
In the dark, the ocean's slaves

[outro - Haven's Voyage]
(fading whisper) Heave ho... iiiii... ooooo...
