lyrics = [intro – Neon Glow]
Woooo  
Soft piano echoes

[verse 1 – City Lights]  
In the night, where dreams align  
Gentle whispers through the skyline  
Ooooooo  

[Pre-Chorus – Heartbeat Pulse]  
Feel the rhythm, close and near  
Every moment crystal clear  
Ahhhh  

[Chorus – Dulcet Groove]  
Together we sway, in this neon embrace  
Hearts beating in time, no more space  
Ooooooo 

[Bridge – Twilight Serenade]  
Lost in the glow, we find our way  
Under the stars, where we stay  
Aaaaaa  

[outro – Dusk's Lullaby]  
Fading lights, soft goodbye  
In the Dulcet groove, we fly  
Wooooo]
