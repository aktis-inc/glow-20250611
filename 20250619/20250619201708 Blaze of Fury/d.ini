[verse 1 - Ember's Call]  
Striking the night, the thunder cracks  
Fire in my veins, no turning back  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiooooo

[chorus - Blaze of Fury]  
Feel the heat, rising high  
In the blaze, we never die  
woooooooaaaaaa

[bridge - Electric Storm]  
Lightning strikes, in the dark  
Hear the metal, feel the spark  
zzzzzzzzzzzz

[verse 2 - Inferno Dance]  
Raging flames, dance in the storm  
In this chaos, we are reborn  
shhhhhaaaaaah

[outro - Ashes and Echoes]  
From the ashes, rise again  
In the fury, find the end  
oooooo iiiiiii
