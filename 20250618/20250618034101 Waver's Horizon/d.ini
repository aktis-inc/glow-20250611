[verse 1 – Horizon Glimpse]
Whispers in the air, soft light through the veil
ooooo iiiiiiiiii
The world unfolds, gently sighs

[chorus – Waver's Embrace]
wooo ooooo
A rhythmic dance, serene and free
Through the clouds, where dreams reside

[instrumental build-up]
[soft echoing waves]

[bridge – Misty Passage]
iiiiii aaaaaa
Flowing through the endless night
Where sound becomes the light

[outro – Fading Echo]
oooooo iiiiiiii
Waver's horizon, a timeless flight
