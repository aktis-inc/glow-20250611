lyrics = [intro - cultural ambiance]
   ahhhh ooooooo iiiiiiiiiii

   [verse 1 - Harmonious Flow]
   Melodies dance in the wind's embrace,
   Strings pluck tales of old and new.  
   Echoes of lands, where dreams weave,  
   Harmonies blend, vivid hues.  
   ssshhhh ooohhh ahhhh

   [Chorus - Rhythmic Pulse]  
   Hands clap, feet move, heart beats in time,  
   Voices rise, in a song divine.  
   ooooo iiii aaaaa

   [Bridge - Fusion Moment]  
   Beyond the borders, where sounds unite,  
   A tapestry of notes, vibrant and bright.  
   ahhhh iiiiii

   [verse 2 - Melodic Journey]
   Across the seas, where cultures meet,  
   Rhythms of life, in a lively beat.  
   History sings, in whispers and cries,  
   A symphony born, under vast skies.  
   iiiiii ooooo

   [Outro - Harmony's End]
   As notes fade, a lingered tune,  
   Remains in the heart, a sweet commune.  
   hhhhhh ooooo
