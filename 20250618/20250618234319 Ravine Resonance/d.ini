lyrics = [intro - serene whispers]
oooooo  
[soft instrumental flow]

[verse 1 - Tranquil Path]  
In the Ravine of sound,  
Gentle whispers of light,  
Flowing through the heart,  
A journey of peace,  
shhhhhh

[chorus - Harmonic Embrace]  
aooooooo  
Embrace the calm,  
Breathe in the light,  
Floating on a serene river,  
Where dreams reside,  
hhhhh

[bridge - Mystical Echoes]  
Soft echoes call,  
In the stillness of the mind,  
A melody of healing,  
Gently intertwined,  
oooo

[outro - Fading Serenity]  
[soft instrumental fade]  
Peaceful whispers,  
To guide you home,  
Endless tranquility,  
In the Ravine alone.
