lyrics = [intro - Rising Dawn]
ooooooo

[verse 1 - City Lights]  
In the heart of steel and stone  
Dreams are forged in the unknown  
Where shadows dance with light  
iiiiiiiiii 

[Pre-Chorus - Echoing Steps]  
oooooo  
Feel the pulse of ambition  
In every breath, every decision

[Chorus - Yalina's Anthem]  
Shine bright under the endless sky  
Let your spirit soar and fly  
oooooo  
Together, we rise

[Bridge - Triumph's Call]  
In the echoes of our name  
We find strength in the flame  
ahhhhhh

[verse 2 - Resilient Heart]  
Through the trials and the pain  
We stand tall, we remain  
In the city's embrace

[outro - Anthem's Glory]  
wooooo  
Forever the anthem will play  
In the light of a new day  
oooooo  
Shine bright, Yalina, shine bright
