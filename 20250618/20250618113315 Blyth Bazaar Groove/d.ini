lyrics = [intro - Bazaar Awakening]
(melodic hum)  
The sun rises over stalls  
Shadows dance, stories call  
oooooo

[verse 1 – Market Whispers]  
Rhythms weave through alleyways  
Colors speak in vibrant arrays  
Sitar strings hum, tabla taps  
Echoes of ancient maps  
iiiii  

[Pre-Chorus – Groove Align]  
In the heart of every beat  
Find the pulse of busy feet  
ooooo

[Chorus – Bazaar Symphony]  
woooooo  
iiiiiiii

[Bridge - Cultural Flow]  
Threads of sound, a tapestry  
We sing a song of unity  
ahhhhhh

[verse 2]  
Coins jingle, laughter rings  
In this dance, the market sings  
Blyth's world, a vibrant spree  

[outro - Fade to Dusk]  
(melodic hum)  
As the sun dips, stories rest  
In the bazaar, we find our quest  
zzzzzz]
