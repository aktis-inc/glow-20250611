[verse 1]
In whispers of the evening glow
Promises linger, softly flow

[pre-chorus - rising warmth]
hearts in gentle sway
oooo oooo

[chorus - heartfelt]
When the night falls, I'll be there
iiiiiiii

[bridge - tender reflection]
Through the quiet, dreams unfold
Liora's promise, stories told

[outro - fading light]
oooo iiiii aaaa
Promises linger, softly flow
