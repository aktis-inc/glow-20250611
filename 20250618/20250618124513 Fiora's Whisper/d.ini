lyrics = [intro - ethereal dawn]

[verse 1]
Whispers of the wind, a gentle call
In twilight's embrace, we stand tall
oooooo

[chorus - Echoes of Fiora]
In the shadows, light unfolds
Embrace the echoes, stories told
iiiiiii

[bridge - Dreamscape]
Floating on a melody, we soar
Through the clouds, forevermore
ahhhh

[verse 2]
Silent paths beneath our feet
In the echoes, hearts will meet
oooooo

[outro - Whisper's End]
Fiora's song, in the night
Guides us through, the endless light
shhhhhhh
