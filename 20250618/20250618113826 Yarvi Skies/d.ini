[verse 1 – High Above]  
The plane lifts off, stories in the wind  
Clouds beneath, where dreams begin  
woooooooo iiiiiii  

[chorus – Yarvi Skies]  
A thousand miles, in the clear blue  
Every tale whispers true  
oooooo iiiii  

[Bridge - Journey's Call]  
Skyline fades, horizon's edge  
Echoes of laughter, a traveler’s pledge  
zzzzzzhhhhh

[verse 2 – Desert Glimpse]  
Through the window, desert sands  
A journey guided by unseen hands  
ahhhh ooooo  

[outro - Into the Horizon]  
The sun dips low, adventure's song  
With Yarvi skies, we belong  
iiiiii aaaaaa]
