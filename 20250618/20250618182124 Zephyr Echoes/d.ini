[verse]

Gentle waves, they roll on by  
Whispered dreams in the sky  
ooooo iiiiii

[chorus]

Zephyr's song, softly calls  
Through the night, as starlight falls  
iiiii ooooo

[bridge]

In the silence, secrets flow  
Hidden paths where only dreams go  
aaaaa iiiiii

[outro]

Carry me on the breeze  
To where my heart finds ease  
ooooo aaaaa
