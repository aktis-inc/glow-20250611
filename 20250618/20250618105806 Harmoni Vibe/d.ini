[verse 1]
In the heart of the dance
Where beats collide
Colors swirl, feet move
Harmoni's pride

[Chorus - Vibe Pulse]

Vera level, in the groove
iiiiii
Feel the rhythm, never move

[Bridge - Festive Echo]
Dance echoes through the night
Cultural strings, taking flight
aaaaa

[verse 2]
Under the moon's radiant glow
Tradition and modern flow
Hands clap, feet tap
Joy in every step

[Drop - Celebration Rise]

Shouts of joy, crowd ignite
Kuthu beats, pure delight

[outro - Harmoni Vibe Fade]
