lyrics = [intro - Neon Horizon]

[verse 1 – Tropical Pulse]  
Waves glow under neon skies  
Vibrant rhythm fills the air  
Laughter echoes through the night  
oooooo iiiiiii  

[Pre-Chorus – Sunset Dance]  
Clap and sway with the breeze  
Every beat a new release  

[Chorus – Qalor Waves]  
Dive into the vibrant sound  
Feel the rhythm all around  
oooo woooo  

[Bridge - Electric Tides]  
Neon palm trees sway and glow  
Tropical beats overflow  
ahhh ahhh  

[verse 2]
Dancing under stars so bright  
Music guides us through the night  
Futures blend with past delights  

[outro - Ride the Rhythm]
