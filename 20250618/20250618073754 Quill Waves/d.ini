ooooo

[verse 1 - Whispered Memories]
In the glow of twilight streets  
Reflections dance, secrets released  
Quill writes in whispers, soft and slow  
ooooo iiiiii

[chorus - Airwaves]
Floating dreams on the radio  
Waves of time, ebb and flow  
ooooo

[bridge - Echoes]
Lost in the night, the city sighs  
Quill's voice a lullaby
aaaaa

[outro - Fading Light]
Gentle whispers fade away  
In the echoes, memories sway  
ooooo iiiiii
