lyrics = [intro - Neon Burst]

[verse 1 – Electric Surge]
Racing through the night, city lights flashing by
Voices echo strong, in this world where dreams don't die
oooooohhhh iiiiiiii

[Pre-Chorus – Voltage Rise]
Pulse in the veins, unstoppable force
Every step ignites, breaking through the noise

[Chorus – Zyra Frenzy]
wooooooo  
Zyra's call, electric storm
iiiiiiiiii

[Bridge - Circuit Break]
Shadows dance, under the neon glow
We are the spark, that sets the world aglow
ahhhhh shhhhhh

[verse 2]
In the chaos, we found our beat
Rhythms collide, in the city's heartbeat

[outro - Fade to Light]
ooooo iiiiiii
Endless horizons, where the future's bright
