lyrics = [intro - ambient river sounds]

[verse - Gentle Flow]
The river sings in silence  
Echoes of the past, they glide  
Through the mist, a soft embrace  
Whispers in the gentle tide

[chorus - Dream's Lullaby]
ooooooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiii

[bridge - Ethereal Drift]
Timeless waters, endless skies  
Reflections dance in moonlit eyes  
aaaaaa  
shhhhhh

[outro - Fading Echoes]
oooo  
iiiiiii  
Flow with me, through time and space
