lyrics = [intro - Moonlit Glimmer]
sssshhhhh

[verse - Shadow Dance]
In the night's embrace, whispers call  
Softly through the silvered leaves  
Echoes of dreams untold  
Underneath the moon's soft glow  

[pre-chorus - Ethereal Pulse]
ooooo   
iiiiiiii   
Silent steps in shadows' grace  
Hidden paths we trace  

[chorus - Haunting Lullaby]
wooooooo  
Aether's shadow, whisper low  
Guide us through the night's glow  

[bridge - Lunar Echo]
Moonlight weaves a silver song  
Gently pulls us along  
zzzzzzz   
whispering shadows  

[outro - Fade to Dawn]
ooooo   
ssshhhh  
Fading into dawn's first light  
Aether's shadow takes flight
