lyrics = [intro]
(soft hum) aaa eeee ooo  
  
[verse 1]  
Gentle whispers in the breeze  
Strings of hope, entwined with dreams  
Flow like rivers in my soul  
Where echoes of silence toll  
  
[chorus]  
Elysian echoes in the night  
Dancing shadows in the light  
Swaying gently, hearts ignite  
oooooooo  
  
[bridge]  
Lost in time, yet here we stand  
Holding stars with open hands  
A melody that never ends  
zzzzzz  
  
[verse 2]  
Through the veil of endless skies  
Voices rising, never dies  
In the quiet, truth is found  
Where heartbeats meet the sound  
  
[outro]  
(soft hum) aaa eeee ooo  
Fade into the eternal glow
