(drum roll) Kairo's whisper, in the night

ooooo iiiiii

[verse 1 – Festive Call]
Echoes of the heart, in rhythm
Melodies weave, tales of dreams
Colors burst, in night's embrace

[Chorus – Rhythmic Beat]

Dance with the stars, under the sky
Feel the beat, let it fly

Voices blend, like rivers flow
Tradition meets the modern glow

Steps align in harmony
Celebrate with every breath
Kairo's spirit, sets us free

(sssshhhhh) Echoes fade, yet linger on
In the heart, a timeless song]
