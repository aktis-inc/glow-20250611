lyrics = [intro - Ocean Whispers]
woooo oooo  
Gentle breeze on the shore  
oooooo iiiiiii

[verse 1 – Tranquil Echoes]  
In the light, where shadows play  
Melodies whisper untold tales  
Waves dance beneath the sky  
ooooo iiiiiii

[Chorus – Sunset Serenade]  
Feel the rhythm, feel the flow  
In the sea's embrace, we glow  
oooooo aaaaaa iiiiii

[Bridge - Golden Horizon]  
The sun dips low, casting gold  
Dreams unfold in the silent hold  
ahhhhhh ooooo  
[soft hum]

[verse 2]  
Stories linger in the air  
With every note, we dare  
To find peace in fleeting time

[outro - Seraph's Lullaby]  
ooooo iiiiiii  
Beneath the stars, we sway  
Into night, gently fade
