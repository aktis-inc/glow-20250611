lyrics = [intro – Neon Pulse]
(Soft vocal humming) eeee aaaa  
ooooo oooooo

[verse 1]  
Whispers through the night air  
Colors dance beyond the sight  
Spirals of what we share  
In the heart of city lights  
zzzzzzhhhhhh

[Chorus – Elaris Echoes]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii

[Bridge - Tradition's Call]  
Strings weep, stories unfold (ahhhh)  
Beats of the past, echoes untold (ok!)  
Ahhhhhh ooooo

[verse 2]  
Rhythms of the ages blend  
Mysteries that never end  
Voices in a timeless song  
Harmony where we belong

[glitch build-up]  
ssshhhh oooo  

[distorted echo] journey… unity… echoes… (oo-yeah!)

[outro - Elaris Echoes]
