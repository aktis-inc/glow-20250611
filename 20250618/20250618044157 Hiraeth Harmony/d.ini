lyrics = [intro - City Pulse]
mmmmmm ooooo
[verse 1 - Urban Reflections]
Lights flicker, shadows dance
In the echo of our glance
Conversations linger on
Are we still, are we gone?

[bridge - Memory Lane]
Soft whispers, time's embrace
Moments lost, we retrace
oooooo iiiiiii

[chorus - Harmonious Echo]
wooooooo
Friendship's call, distant song
In the night, we belong
iiiiiiii

[verse 2 - Connection's Thread]
Words unspoken, hearts align
In the rhythm, we find time
oooo ahhhh

[outro - Fade to Silence]
shhhhhh ooooo
Echoes fade, yet remain
In the sound, we sustain
