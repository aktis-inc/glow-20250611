lyrics = [intro]

[sitar strum]

[verse - Rhythmic Dance]
In shadows, echoes rise
A world unfolds, untamed tides

[chorus - Harmony Unite]
Dharna's call, through time it flows
ooooo iiiii
In silence, the melody grows

[bridge - Ethereal Drift]
Ancient whispers, modern beat
Together, the worlds meet

[verse - Crescendo]
Rhythms pulse, hearts align
In the fusion, a sacred sign

[outro - Fade to Harmony]
iiiiii ooooo
Symphony's end, a timeless rhyme
