lyrics = [intro rhythm]
(Soft chanting) Daurin calls, the desert hums  
iiiiiiiiiiiii  
ooooooo  

[verse 1 – Sand Whispers]  
Echoes in the wind, tales of old  
Rhythms of the heart, unfold  
Desert dreams, in melodies told  
ahhhhhh  

[Pre-Chorus – Oasis Flow]  
[gentle rise]  
oooooo  
In the sand, where stories blend  
Every note, a timeless friend  

[Chorus – Horizon Dance]  
woooooo  
iiiiiiiiyaaaa  

[Bridge - Mirage Beat]  
Dance with shadows, in the glow  
Time and space, in rivers flow  
Ahhhh shhhhhh  
[echoed chants]  

[verse 2]  
Colors of the earth, in sound  
Traditions merge, all around  
Future calls, in the present found  

[glitch build-up]  
shhhhhh ooooo  

[distorted echo] rhythm… life… connection… (oh-yeah!)  

[outro - Daurin Echoes]
