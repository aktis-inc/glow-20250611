[verse 1 - Urban Pulse]  
In the shadows, echoes call  
Between the walls, where dreams fall

[Bridge - Rising Tides]  
oooooo  
iiiiiiii

[Chorus - Skyward]  
Strength in silence, voices rise  
Through the city, under skies  
wooooooo

[verse 2 - Echoes]  
Footsteps trace the paths we've tread  
Unseen threads, stories said  
zzzzzzz

[Drop - Final Descent]  
oooooo  
iiiiiii

[outro - Fading Lights]
