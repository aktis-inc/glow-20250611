wooo  
iiii  
  
[verse 1 – Heart's Echo]  
Strings of fate, whispering dreams  
Through the shadows, love redeems  
oooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiii  
  
[Chorus – Serenade's Embrace]  
Melody of longing, heartbeats align  
In this dance, our souls intertwine  
ahhhh  
mmmmmm  
  
[Bridge – Timeless Whispers]  
City lights fade, as dreams ignite  
In this serenade, we take flight  
oooo  
eeeee  
  
[verse 2 – Dream's Lullaby]  
Gentle breeze, soft steps in time  
In your eyes, stars brightly chime  
zzzzzzhhhhh  
  
[outro – Cadenza Refrain]  
Tender echoes, love's refrain  
In our hearts, the melody remains  
oooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiii]
