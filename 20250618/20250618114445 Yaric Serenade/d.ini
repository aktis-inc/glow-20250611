lyrics = [intro - gentle lull]

[verse - Night's Whisper]
Softly through the shadowed trees  
A melody of dreams takes flight  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

[Pre-Chorus - Heartstrings]
wwwwww  
In the garden where time stands still  
Our hearts entwine with the night's embrace  

[Chorus - Serenade]
ooooo  
Yaric's gentle serenade  
Echoes through the vast expanse  

[Bridge - Moonlit Dance]
In this enchanted space, we float  
Our souls in rhythm, tender and pure  

[verse - Eternal Echo]
The stars above, silent witnesses  
To our whispered vows of love  

[outro - Fading Light]
As dawn breaks, the serenade fades  
But in our hearts, it forever stays
