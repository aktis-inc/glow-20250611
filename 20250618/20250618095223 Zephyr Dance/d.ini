lyrics = [intro - playful breeze]

[verse 1]
The rhythm flows, ancient rivers run
In the heart, echoes of a timeless song
oooooo

[Pre-Chorus – Fusion Pulse]
Strings and winds, a dance of the past
iiiiiiii

[Chorus – Zephyr's Call]
Feel the beat, like a whispering breeze
Through the night, the music frees
oooooo  
iiiiiiii

[Bridge - Echoes of Tradition]
Time's embrace, in the sound we trust
A dance of worlds, in harmony
shhhhhh

[verse 2]
Notes collide, in a festival of dreams
Traditions rise, with a modern gleam

[outro - Zephyr Dance]
The melody fades, a gentle goodbye
In the air, the zephyr's sigh
oooooo]
