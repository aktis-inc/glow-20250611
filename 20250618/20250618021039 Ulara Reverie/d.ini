lyrics = [intro - soft nostalgia]
(soft hum) oooo
Gentle echoes of time
iiiiiiiii

[verse 1 ‚Äì Whispered Dreams]
In the glow of olden days
Love‚Äôs melody whispers (in echoes)
Heartstrings gently play
Through the veil of time, we sway

[chorus ‚Äì Eternal Embrace]
ooooooo
Wrapped in the warmth of yesterday
Hearts entwined, forever stay
iiiiiiiii

[verse 2 ‚Äì Whispers of the Past]
Underneath the starlit skies
Every touch, a tender sigh
Memories in soft reprise
Love‚Äôs embrace, never dies

[outro ‚Äì Ulara Reverie]
(soft hum) oooo
In dreams, we find our way
Through the echoes of yesterday
shhhhh
