lyrics = [intro - rhythmic awakening]

[sitar and tabla intro]
oooooo

[verse]
Golden petals in the wind
Whispers of a timeless song
In the dance of dreams, we spin
Echoes of the past, where we belong

[Pre-Chorus]
shhhhhh
Harmony of hearts, entwined
In this moment, we find

[Chorus]
wooooooo
Dhalia dreams, in endless flight
Through the night, into the light

[Bridge - Ethereal Flow]
Rhythms weave the tapestry
Of stories told in melody
ahhhhhhh

[verse]
Spirits of the ancient lands
Guide us with their gentle hands
In the dance of dreams, we stand
Boundless skies, an endless strand

[outro - fading echoes]
oooooo iiiiiiii
