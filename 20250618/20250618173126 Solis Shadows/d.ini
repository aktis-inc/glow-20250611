lyrics = [intro - eerie chimes]
(whispered voice) Solis shadows… lurking deep  
(mechanical echo) iiiiiiiiii...  
[verse 1 – Haunting Whispers]  
Machines awaken in the dark  
Their eyes gleam with hidden tales  
Soft echoes in the midnight park  
A chilling dance, no one prevails  

[Chorus – Midnight Pulse]  
oooooo   
iiiiiiiii  
Solis shadows, creeping slow  
In the night, they softly glow  

[Bridge - Mechanical Lullaby]  
Tick-tock, the time slips away  
Whirring echoes, haunting play  
A dance of gears, silent sway  
Solis whispers, come what may  

[glitch build-up]  
zzzzzsssshhhhh  

[outro - Fading Echo]  
(whispered voice) Shadows linger… in Solis' glow  
(mechanical echo) oooooo…
