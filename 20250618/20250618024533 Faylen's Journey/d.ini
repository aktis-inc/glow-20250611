lyrics = [intro - gentle river flow]

[verse 1 - Faylen's Call]
Harmonies echo through time
Pathways woven in the soil
Life's tapestry, vibrant and alive
ooooo iiiii

[chorus - Rhythmic Heartbeat]
Ancient tales, whispered soft
In the dance of the leaves
Faylen's call, a timeless song

[bridge - Soul's Reflection]
In the quiet of the dawn
Embrace the journey, unfold
With each step, stories untold

[verse 2 - Cultural Echo]
Rhythms pulse beneath the sky
Tradition's voice, ever bright
Melodies that never die

[outro - Faylen's Journey]
Flow through the river of dreams
Ancient whispers, guiding light
Fade into the night
