[verse]

Softly the night whispers cheer  
A glow of joy, warmth so near

[chorus]

ooooooo  
iiiiiiii

[verse]

Candles flicker, hearts align  
In this moment, stars align

[bridge - festive rise]

oooo aaaa  
Joy to the world, softly sung

[outro - gentle fade]  
The echo of Dallin's dream  
shhhhhhh ooooo
