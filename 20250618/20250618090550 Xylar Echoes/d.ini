lyrics = [intro riff]

[guitar solo]

[verse 1 â€“ Electric Dreams]
Strum the strings of time
Echoes of legends past
Feel the thunder's climb
Rock's eternal blast
oooooo

[Chorus â€“ Sonic Wave]
Ride the lightning, feel alive
In the echoes, we survive
Xyyyyy

[verse 2 â€“ Amplified Pulse]
In the shadows, fire ignites
Guitar wails through the night
Stars align in electric dreams
Riff and rhythm, bursting seams

[guitar solo]

[Bridge - Echo Chamber]
Through the storm, through the flame
Rock and roll, call my name
Ahhhh

[Chorus â€“ Sonic Wave]
Ride the lightning, feel alive
In the echoes, we survive
Xyyyyy ooooo

[outro - Fade to Silence]
