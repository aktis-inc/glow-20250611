[verse 1]
Umara's call in twilight's glow  
Gentle waves in rhythmic flow  
hmmmmm oooo  

[chorus - echo of the past]  
Strings entwine, voices soar  
Across the night, forevermore  
oooo aaaaa 

[bridge - serene passage]  
Dancing shadows, timeless grace  
In this moment, we embrace  
iiiiii ooooo  

[outro - fading light]  
Umara, serenade of dreams  
Within the silence, all redeems  
shhhh iiiiiiii]
