[verse 1 – Celestial Murmurs]
Softly the heartbeats echo through time
Whispers of love in the quiet night
Beneath the stars, secrets unfold
oooooo

[Chorus – Seraph's Embrace]  
Gentle touch, a guiding light
In the silence, the truth ignites
iiiiiiiii

[Bridge – Dreamscape]  
Floating on a sea of dreams
Where reality meets the unseen
Ahhh ooooh

[verse 2]
In the stillness, the soul finds peace
A journey through the heart's release
Softly it calls, a tender plea

[Outro – Fading Light]
Seraph's call, a lullaby
Guiding us to the endless sky
oooo iiiii
