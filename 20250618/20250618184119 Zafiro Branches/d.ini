[verse 1 - Whispering Pines]
In the shadow of the hills
Where the old tales breathe
Stories linger, soft as wind
A heart's gentle weave

[chorus - Skyward Gaze]
ooooo
Branches reaching high
Underneath the sapphire sky
iiiiii
Memories held in time

[bridge - Echoes of Yesterday]
Footsteps on the trodden path
oooooo
Ghosts of the past
Whispers in the grass

[outro - Fading Light]
Sunset kisses the land
A journey's end, hand in hand
ooooo aaaa
