[whisper]

[drop - ethereal burst]

[verse - Neon Dreams]

In the city's glow, shadows dance  
Hearts beat with the pulse of light  
iiiiiii oooooo  
Echoes of tomorrow, in the night

[Chorus - Haven's Release]  
ooooo iiiiiii  
Feel the rhythm set us free  
Whispering winds, take us higher

[Bridge - Electric Dawn]  
A journey through the veils of time  
With every beat, we rise anew  
shhhhhhh ahhhhhh  
The city breathes with us

[outro - Fade to Light]
