[guitar whispers]

[verse 1 - Soft Echoes]
Under the amber glow
Gratitude flows gently
Silent whispers carry hope

[Chorus - Embrace]
Ahhh ooo
Beneath the sky
Thankful heart, open soul

[Bridge - Warmth]
Every note a gentle touch
Harmonies like morning light
Uuuu oooo

[outro - Fading Light]
Echoes linger, softly fade
Gratitude remains, a gentle wave
