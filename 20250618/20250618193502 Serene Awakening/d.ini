lyrics = [intro - soft awakening]

[verse 1 - Meadow's Call]
Gentle light, breaks through the night
Whispers of the dawn, softly glide
oooooo

[Chorus - Serene Embrace]
Beneath the sky, where dreams reside
Every moment, a gentle tide
iiiiiiii

[Bridge - Echoes of Spring]
Footsteps on grass, echoes of spring
In the silence, the world begins
shhhhhh

[outro - Dawn's Whisper]
Serene awakening, the day unfolds
In the quiet, stories told
ooooo iiiiii
