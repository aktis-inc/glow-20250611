lyrics = [intro - Whisper of Dawn]
rustling leaves, gentle chimes

[verse - Emergence]  
In the heart of the sound  
Rhythms pulse, stories unfold  
A dance of echoes

[Chorus - Vibrant Echoes]  
oooooo  
iiiiiiiiii  
Talon's call resonates

[Bridge - Journey's Path]  
Through the ancient woods  
Voices of the earth rise  
Flowing with the stream

[outro - Fading Light]  
soft echoes, gentle fade  
shhhhhhh ooo
