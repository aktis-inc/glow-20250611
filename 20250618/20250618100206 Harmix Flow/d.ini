yeeeeeeeaaaaaahhhh

[verse 1 – Harmix Groove]
Rollin' through the city, skyline in sight
Piano keys dance in the twilight
Bass hits low, rhythm takes flight
oooooo

[Chorus – Neon Vibe]
oooooo  
iiiiii
Let the flow guide, Harmix in control
City lights a backdrop, where stories unfold

[Bridge - Glass Reflections]
Reflecting dreams in neon beams, cruising slow
Urban tales whispered in the breeze, let it flow
ahhhhhhh

[verse 2 – West Coast Echo]
Echoes of legends in every beat
Timeless rhythms under the street
Confidence in every word we speak

[outro]
woooooooo
Harmix rides the rhythm, the city's own beat
oooooooo
