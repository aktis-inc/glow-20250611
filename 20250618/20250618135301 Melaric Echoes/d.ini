lyrics = [intro - gentle breeze]
[verse 1 - Whispers of Time]  
Melodi berdansa di angin  
Menembus ruang, mengalir bebas  
ooooooooo  
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

[Pre-Chorus - Harmony's Call]  
[soft tabla beat]  
oooooo  
Suara hati, berbisik lembut  
Menggugah jiwa, mengisi ruang

[Chorus - Echoes of Melaric]  
wooooooo  
iiiiiii  
Menggetarkan, penuh rasa  
Mengalun lembut di jiwa

[Bridge - Thread of Tradition]  
Nada kuno, merangkai cerita  
Irama baru, membaur indah  
Ahhhhhh shhhh  
[echoed breath]

[verse 2 - Time's Reflection]  
Kenangan lama, dalam nada  
Berpadu dengan hari ini  
Harmoni abadi, menggema

[outro - Melaric's Whisper]
