lyrics = [intro - Echoes of Time]

[verse]
Whispers of the past, in the stillness
Dreams unfold, like petals in the night
iiii aaaa ooo

[bridge]
Hearts entwined, in gentle harmony
Every note a thread, weaving destiny
oooo iiiiii

[chorus]
Feel the rise, the fall, the endless dance
Harmonia sings, with every glance
oooo aaaa

[verse 2]
Footsteps in the sand, stories untold
In the winds of change, we find our hold
zzzz ooooo

[outro - Fading Light]
In the silence, echoes remain
Harmonia's call, a sweet refrain
oooo iiiii]
