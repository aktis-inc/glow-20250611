lyrics = [intro - Mystic Winds]
oooooooooo  
[verse - Ancient Echoes]  
Chanting through time, whispers of old  
The pulse of the earth, stories unfold  
iiiiiiiiiii  
[chorus - Celestial Harmony]  
Ethereal voices, rise and flow  
In sacred dance, the spirits glow  
[bridge - Rhythm of Ages]  
Drum beats like heartbeats, in eternal sway  
Guiding the soul, showing the way  
ooooo  
[outro - Ithara's Embrace]  
Fading into silence, with a sigh  
A timeless melody, in the sky
