[verse 1 - Gentle Waves]
Under the canopy of stars
Whispers of the night, soft and far
ooooo iiiii

[chorus - Heart's Echo]
In the stillness, find the way
Dreams unfold, come what may
ooooohh aaaaa

[bridge - Serenity's Call]
Flowing tides, carry the song
With each breath, where I belong
shhhhhhh

[verse 2 - Nature's Lullaby]
Echoes of the heart, gentle sway
In this moment, I choose to stay
aaaaaa iiiiii

[outro - Fading Light]
Fading light, eternal rest
In this journey, I've been blessed
ooooo iiiii]
