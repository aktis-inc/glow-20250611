lyrics = [intro - Whispering Shadows]

[verse 1 - Desert Echoes]  
Under the moonlit canopy  
Stories drift like a gentle breeze  
Silent roads where secrets meet  
In this mirage, time stands still

[Chorus - Mirage Melody]  
woooooo  
iiiiii  
Dreams whisper in corridors  
Echoes of forgotten songs

[Bridge - Twilight Reflections]  
Through the haze, silhouettes dance  
Shadows blend in a timeless trance  
oooooo  
ahhhh

[verse 2 - Lost Reverie]  
Paths untread, whispers untold  
Mysteries in the night unfold  
In this place, where dreams reside

[guitar solo - Ethereal Strings]  
iiiiiiii

[outro - Cadenza Mirage]
