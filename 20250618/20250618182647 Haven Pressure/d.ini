lyrics = [intro - synth pulse]

[verse 1]
Night falls, shadows crawl
Pressure mounts, can't escape the call
oooooo iiiiiii

[chorus - Haven Release]
Pressure builds, storm in the night
Find my haven, in the city lights
woooooooo

[bridge - Neon Pulse]
City breathes, under neon skies
In the noise, a secret lies
aaaaa ooohhhh

[verse 2]
Rhythms clash, streets alive
In the chaos, we survive
zzzzzzzz

[outro - Echo Fade]
Pressure fades, haven remains
In the silence, only echoes stay
oooo iiiiii]
