lyrics = [intro - soft dawn]
oooooo   
iiiiii

[verse 1 - Morning Light]
Guitar whispers to the dawn
In stillness, echoes softly drawn
Nature's breath, a gentle song  
ahhhhhhh

[Chorus - Embrace]
Waves of warmth, around we sway
In this light, we find our way
oooooooo

[Bridge - Whispered Affection]
Softly held, the heart's refrain
In Lumira's echo, love remains
ahhh ahhhhh oooh

[outro - Tranquil Fade]
[soft fade]
whispers of the sky
gentle lullaby
