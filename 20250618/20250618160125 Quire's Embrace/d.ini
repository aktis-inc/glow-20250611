lyrics = [intro - Whispering Winds]

[piano interlude]

[verse 1 – Gentle Whispers]
Veils of light, where shadows dance
Echoes in the heart, a tender trance
mmmmm oooooo

[Pre-Chorus – Heart's Call]
Softly, softly, the world slows down
Between the silence, love's profound
iiiiiiii

[Chorus – Embrace]
Hold me close, where dreams reside
In your arms, the stars collide
aaaaa ooooo

[Bridge - Endless Horizon]
A thousand words, a single glance
Time stands still, love's eternal dance
shhhhhhh

[verse 2]
Through the night, our spirits soar
Boundless skies, forevermore
ooooooo

[outro - Fading Light]
Whispering winds, carry our song
In the silence, where we belong]
