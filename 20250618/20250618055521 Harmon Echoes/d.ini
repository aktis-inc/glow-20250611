[verse]
In the dance of time, echoes intertwine
Soulful strings, an ancient rhyme
ooooo iiiiiii

[chorus]
Harmon flows, where the rivers meet
Melodies weave, in the city's heartbeat
sssshhhhhh

[bridge]
Traditions whisper, in modern hues
A symphony of colors, vibrant and true
aaaaa eeeeee

[outro]
Echoes fade, but the spirit stays
Harmony lingers, in endless ways
ooooo iiiiiii]
