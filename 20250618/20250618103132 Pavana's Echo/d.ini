lyrics = [intro - Soft Strings]

[verse 1]
Guitar whispers through the night  
Stories told in fading light  
oooooo  
iiiiii

[Pre-Chorus - Echoes]
Gentle breeze, carry me  
To places where I long to be  
woooooooo

[Chorus - Heartfelt Strum]
Pavana's echo, soft and clear  
Tales of dreams, whispered near  
oooo iiiii

[Bridge - Calm Reflection]
In the quiet, find the way  
Lost in thoughts of yesterday  
ahhhh  

[outro - Fading Light]
Strings of gold, fade to grey  
In Pavana's arms, I sway  
ooooo iiiii
