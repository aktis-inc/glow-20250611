lyrics = [intro soft]

[verse 1 – Reflections]
Mirror tells the quiet tales  
Of moments lost, whispered trails  
ooooo  
iiiiiii  

[bridge – Inner Light]  
Through the ripple of the glass  
A story of what's past  

[chorus – Heartbeat Echo]  
wooooo  
Emotions flow like rivers deep  
In the stillness, secrets keep  

[verse 2 – Silent Gaze]
Eyes meet their own gaze in time  
Searching for the hidden rhyme  
oooo oooo  
iiiiiiiiii  

[outro – Mira's Reflection]  
In the mirror, truth aligns  
A dance of the heart and mind
