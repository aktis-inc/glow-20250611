ooooo  
ooooo

[verse 1 – First Light]
Waves of sound, the city stirs
In the shadows, dreams converge  
Embers of hope ignite the sky  
A new day calls, we rise as one  

[Pre-Chorus – Awakening Call]  
eeeeee  
Wake up, wake up, the world awaits  
iiiiiii

[Chorus – Anthem of Light]  
Rise and shine, hearts align  
ooooo  
ooooo

[Bridge - Symphony of Hope] 
Strings of dawn, voices blend (together)
Harmony flows, no end (forever)
aaaaa  
ooooo

[verse 2]
Through the echoes, we find our way  
In the rhythm, dawn's embrace  
Every step, a beat of life  
Together we soar, beyond the night  

[outro - Cadenza Awakening]
ooooo  
ooooo  
Awakened light, we stand as one  
The city's song, a new day's begun
