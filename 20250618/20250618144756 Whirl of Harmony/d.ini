whiiiiiiirl

[verse 1]
Strings sing of distant lands
Percussions dance, hold my hand
Across the seas, rhythms blend
iiii oooo

[chorus]
Harmonies in a whirl, we rise
In the fusion of skies
Ethereal tones, echoing wide
oooo ahhhh

[bridge]
Traditions meet the modern way
In this dance, we sway
Whirl of harmony, we stay
ooohhh iiiii

[outro]
Strings fade with the light
In the night, we take flight
In the silence, whispers bright
whiiiiiiiiirl
