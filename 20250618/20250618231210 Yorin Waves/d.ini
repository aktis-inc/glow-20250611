wooo  
ahhhh  

[verse 1 – Urban Escape]  
Night lights flash, city pulse  
Echoes of dreams in the air  
Waves of rhythm, hearts align  

[Pre-Chorus – Rhythmic Flow]  
Dance with the moon, steps untold  
Feel the beat, let it unfold  
oooooo  

[Chorus – Cloud Dance]  
iiiiii  
Ride the waves, skyward bound  
In the clouds, we’re lost and found  

[Bridge – Neon Dreams]  
Streets alive, stories blend  
Past and future, hand in hand  
ahhhh ooooh  

[verse 2 – Vibrant Pulse]  
Colors swirl, rhythm's grace  
Every step a time embrace  
Wooo  
ahhh  

[outro - Yorin Waves]
