[verse 1 - Vivid Streets]
Echoes of the night, colors in the air
Zypher's steps dance, weaving through the flare
iiiiiiiiiiiiii

[chorus - Bold Moves]
Woo yeah, find the beat within
Vibe electric, let the journey begin
oooo

[bridge - Urban Canvas]
Painted dreams, flowing in the scene
Sketching life, vibrant and unseen
zzzzzzzzhhh

[verse 2]
Rhythm in the chaos, melody in the rush
Zypher's voice, a confident hush
ahhhh ooooo

[outro - Fade to Color]
City breathes, under the neon glow
Zypher moves, with the urban flow
