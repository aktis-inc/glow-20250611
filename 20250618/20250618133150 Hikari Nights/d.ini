[verse 1 – Awakening Echo]  
숨결에 담긴 이야기  
아버지의 꿈은 살아있어  
도시에 빛이 깃들면  
우리는 어둠을 두고 떠나

[Pre-Chorus – Rising Pulse]  
oooooo ooo  
나의 길, 나의 밤  
별들이 속삭이는 비밀  
   
[Chorus – Hikari Burst]  
wooooo  
iiiiii   
   
[Bridge - Dreamscape]  
아침이 밝아오면  
우리는 자유로워져  
빛의 속도로 달려가  
   
[verse 2]  
기억 속의 음성  
지금도 나를 이끌어  
모든 순간을 놓치지 않아

[build-up]  
ooooo iiiiiii  
   
[drop - Euphoric Light]  
wooooo  
oooo   

[outro - Night to Day]
